      "story": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Neighbours by Tim Winton</strong></p> <p><br /></p><p>Written by Shriram Lamichhane | © The SR Zone</p><p><br /></p> <h2><span>Exercise</span></h2> <p><strong>Understanding the text</strong></p> <p><strong>Answer the following questions.</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Describe how the young couple’s house looked like.</strong></p> <p><strong>=</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>The young couple's house was small but had high ceilings and paned windows, giving it the feel of an elegant cottage.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. How did the young couple recognize their neighbours in the beginning of their arrival?</strong></p> <p><strong>=</strong>The young couple recognized their neighbors in the beginning because their neighbors behaved in ways that seemed strange and noisy to them. The neighbors would shout, argue, and make loud noises. They didn't have good hygiene, and they complained about the couple's dog. All of this gave the young couple a negative impression of their neighborhood when they first arrived.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. How did the neighbours assist the young couple in the kitchen garden?</strong></p> <p><strong>=&nbsp;</strong><span>Neighbours helped the young couple both orally and physically in their kitchen garden.&nbsp;</span>They helped the young couple in their kitchen garden by offering advice about planting and gardening practices. They gave tips on spacing, hilling, and mulching. <span>They provided them with some seeds and plants of vegetables as well.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Why were the people in the neighbourhood shocked at the role of the young man and his wife in their family?</strong></p> <p><strong>=&nbsp;</strong>The people in the neighborhood were surprised at the role of the young man and his wife in their family because they were not following the traditional gender roles. The young man stayed home to write his thesis while his wife worked, which was unconventional at that time.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. How did the neighbours respond when they learned about the woman’s pregnancy?</strong></p> <p><strong>=&nbsp;</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>The neighbours responded to the woman's pregnancy with warmth and support. They smiled at the young couple, gave them gifts, and offered suggestions for baby names. They even knitted a baby suit for the expected child.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. Why did the young man begin to cry at the end of the story?</strong></p> <p><strong>= &nbsp;</strong>The young man began to cry at the end of the story because he realized that his neighbors cared about him and his family. He saw their happiness and applause when his baby was born, and it touched his heart. He had previously been upset with his neighbors for getting involved in his life, but now he understood that they were just showing love and care. His feelings toward his neighbors changed, and he cried tears of gratitude for their kindness.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. Why did the author not characterize the persons in the story with proper names?</strong></p> <p><strong>=&nbsp;</strong>The author may have chosen not to characterize the persons in the story with proper names to create a sense of universality and anonymity. This allows readers to relate to the characters as representative of everyday people and emphasizes the themes of community and connection rather than individual identities.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference to the context</strong></p> <p><strong>a. The story depicts that linguistic and cultural barriers do not create any obstacles in human relationships. Explain with some examples from this story where the neighbours have transcended such barriers.</strong></p> <p><span>= In the story, language and cultural differences do not hinder human connections. There are many e</span>xamples of transcending linguistic and cultural barriers in the story.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The neighbors offer gardening advice and even give the young couple garlic cloves to plant, showing a shared interest in gardening that goes beyond language. The neighbors knit a baby suit and offer support during the pregnancy, demonstrating care and bonding that goes beyond cultural differences. When the baby is born, the neighbors cheer and celebrate together, regardless of their diverse cultural backgrounds.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. The last sentence of the story says “The twentieth-century novel had not prepared him for this.” In your view, what differences did the young man find between twentieth-century novels and human relations?</strong></p> <p><strong>=&nbsp;</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>The last sentence of the story, \"The twentieth-century novel had not prepared him for this,\" means that the young man realized that what he learned from books didn't fully prepare him for real life. It suggests that the young man realized that the complexity and depth of human relationships could not be fully understood or prepared for by simply reading books, especially when it came to the unexpected joy and connection he felt with his neighbors during the birth of his child.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>He initially had a certain view of immigrants based on what he read in twentieth-century novels. However, experiencing real-life interactions with his neighbors changed his perspective. He was surprised by the warmth and kindness of his neighbors and how different it was from what he expected. This made him understand the value of real human connections compared to what he had read in books.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. A Nepali proverb says “Neighbors are the companions for the wedding procession as well as for the funeral procession.” Does this proverb apply in the story? Justify.</strong></p> <p><strong>=&nbsp;</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>The Nepali proverb, \"Neighbors are companions for the wedding procession as well as for the funeral procession,\" reflects the strong sense of social harmony and community relationships in Nepali society.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In our culture, when someone has a wedding, neighbors not only join in the celebration but also actively assist with the preparations. It's nearly impossible to carry out such ceremonies without the support of neighbors, except in cases where events are held at venues like party palaces or hotels. Similarly, when a family faces unexpected or sorrowful circumstances, the entire community stands ready to share in their grief.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>This proverb also applies to the story. When the young couple began gardening, their neighbors offered valuable assistance, providing suggestions and even materials and seeds for various vegetables. They shared their knowledge on how to cultivate a successful garden. This demonstrates how neighbors came to their aid when they needed it.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Furthermore, their neighbors also joined in their moments of joy and celebration, such as the birth of their baby. This illustrates the essence of the Nepali proverb, emphasizing that neighbors are not only companions during times of sorrow but also during moments of happiness and celebration.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. The author has dealt with an issue of multiculturalism in the story. Why do you think multiculturalism has become a major issue in the present world?</strong></p> <p><strong>=&nbsp;</strong><span>Multiculturalism is coexistence or mixture of cultures.&nbsp;</span>Having many different cultures living together in one place can be good but also hard.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /></p> <p>People may speak different languages. This can cause problems talking to each other and understanding each other. Miscommunications can happen.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Cultural differences sometimes lead to fights and arguments, especially about beliefs. This social tension needs to be solved with good talking and cultural sharing.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Groups may stick only with people from their own culture. This divides society and makes some people or groups feel alone and isolated.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Workplaces with many cultures can face challenges too, like conflicts, misunderstandings, and unfair judgments. Employers must promote inclusion.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>While cultural diversity enriches our lives and thinking, it also has challenges. But these can be addressed with education, respectful discussions between groups, and rules that treat everyone equally and fairly. Overall, managing cultural variety well creates a better community.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference beyond the text</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Write an essay on Celebration of Childbirth in my Community.</strong></p> <p><strong>=&nbsp;</strong>In my culture, we celebrate a new baby's birth through an event called Nwaran. This happens nine days after the birth. Family and community members gather to share in the joy.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>A new baby brings happiness to the whole family. Guests come to congratulate the mother and newborn. Everyone is excited to see the new little one.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>During Nwaran, the baby receives its name. It is a community celebration, not just a family thing. Neighbors also attend to wish the parents well. People sing, dance and enjoy good food together.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>We do not have baby showers before the birth like some other cultures. I think importing foreign traditions goes against our own ways. Outsider customs have influenced our society too much.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Do the people in your community respond with similar reactions upon the pregnancy and childbirth as depicted in the story? Give a couple of examples.</strong></p> <p><strong>=</strong><span>Yes, they do.</span>People in our community are very helpful and supportive of each other. They celebrate both happy and difficult times together. This has helped strengthen relationships between neighbors.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Our culture values pregnancy and motherhood. When a baby is expected, the whole family and neighborhood takes part in celebrations. Pregnant women are treated with great respect. Families and friends pray for the health of the mother and baby. During pregnancy, the expecting mother receives good advice and support from loved ones. She is cared for and given gifts.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The birth of a baby is a big event for the whole community. Everyone gets excited when a new child arrives. Guests come to congratulate the parents and rejoice over the baby's first cry. The new mother and baby are welcomed and cared for by the entire extended family.</p> <p><br /></p><p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

      "story": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span>&nbsp;\"A Respectable Woman\" by Kate Chopin</span></p> <p><br /></p><p>Written by Shriram Lamichhane | © The SR Zone</p><p><br /></p> <h2><span>Exercise</span></h2> <p><strong>Understanding the text&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Answer the following questions.</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Why was Mrs. Baroda not happy with the information about Gouvernail’s visit to their farm?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Mrs. Baroda was unhappy with the information about Gouvernail's visit to their farm because she had been looking forward to a period of uninterrupted rest and quality time alone with her husband after busy work of sugar plantation. She felt that the arrival of Gouvernail would disturb this plan.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. How was Gouvernail different from Mrs. Baroda’s thinking?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Gouvernail was different from Mrs. Baroda's expectation because she had formed a negative image of him based on her husband's descriptions. She had imagined him as tall, slim, cynical, with eyeglasses, and a somewhat unlikable person. However, when she met him, she found him to be slim but not very tall or cynical, and he didn't wear eyeglasses. He was also polite and courteous, which was different from her initial perception.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. How does Mrs. Baroda compare the guest - Gouvernail with her husband?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Mrs. Baroda compares Gouvernail with her husband, Gaston, by noting that Gouvernail is more reserved and quiet in contrast to Gaston's frank, &nbsp;interesting, adaptive, friendly, and talkative nature. She observes that while Gouvernail doesn't actively engage in conversation like her husband does.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Why and how did Mrs. Baroda attempt to change Gouvernail’s solitary habits?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>Mrs. Broda wanted to change his solitary habit because she wanted Gouvernail to be more open and talkative to her.&nbsp;</span>For this, Mrs. Baroda tried to get Gouvernail to be more social. She walked with him, talked to him, and tried to make him feel comfortable by starting conversations and spending time with him. She wanted him to be more open and friendly.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. How does Gaston not agree with his wife on Gouvernail’s character?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Gaston disagrees with his wife. She thinks Gouvernail isn't friendly or interesting. But Gaston says Gouvernail is a good and respectable person. He believes Gouvernail has many great qualities, but he's just tired from working too much. He asks his wife not to treat him badly.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. Why is Gaston surprised by his wife’s expression towards the end of the story?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Gaston is surprised at his wife's expression near the end because she suggests that Gouvernail should visit them again, even though she didn't like him at first. Gaston is happy and surprised by her change of mind. He didn't expect her to be so accommodating and friendly toward Gouvernail after her initial dislike.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;Reference to the context&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>a. What is the reason for conflict in Mrs. Baroda’s mind? What role does Mrs. Baroda &nbsp;‘being a respectable woman’ play in this story?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The reason Mrs. Baroda is conflicted in her mind is because she's starting to like her husband's friend, Gouvernail. She's torn between her feelings and what society expects from her as a respectable woman. Society expects her to follow certain rules and behave a certain way, which makes it hard for her to show her feelings for Gouvernail openly. This creates a conflict inside her.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Sketch the character of Gouvernail and contrast it with Gaston.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>b. Gouvernail is quiet and thoughtful. He doesn't talk much and prefers to observe. He's a journalist who works hard. In contrast, Gaston, Mrs. Baroda's husband, is outgoing and chatty. He's also caring and understanding. Gouvernail is quiet and reflective, while Gaston is more expressive.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Why does Mrs. Baroda not disclose her feelings towards Gouvernail to her husband?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>c. Mrs. Baroda keeps her feelings for Gouvernail a secret from her husband because she knows society expects her to be a proper wife and woman. She's afraid that if she admits her attraction to Gouvernail, it could harm her marriage and go against society's rules. She also doesn't want to hurt her husband or cause problems between him and his friend.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. The last three sentences of the story make a kind of twist. After reading these three sentences, how will you analyze Mrs. Baroda’s attitude towards Gouvernail?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>When Mrs. Baroda says to Gouvernail, \"I have overcome everything! This time I will be really kind to him,\" it causes a surprise turn in the story.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>This unexpected change indicates she's come to terms with her feelings and is open to having a better relationship with Gouvernail, despite her initial doubts.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>However, there could be another meaning. She may have learned more about what she wants as a woman. By being kind to Gouvernail now, maybe she plans to follow her true feelings for him, without hiding behind social norms.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>So the story takes an unexpected turn, as Mrs. Baroda decides to go with her heart instead of what people expect. This statement leaves things unclear about whether she just wants to be a normal friend with him by hiding her true feelings, or will act on her real feelings for Gouvernail.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference beyond the text&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>a. The entry of an outsider into a family has been a recurring subject in both literature and movies. Narrate a story real or imaginative where an outsider’s arrival destroys the intimate relationship between the husband and the wife and causes break up in marital relationship without the direct mistake of anyone. Anton Chekhov’s story ‘About Love’ is the story on this subject.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>\"About Love\" by Anton Chekhov tells this story. Mr. and Mrs. Luganovich have a happy marriage at first, even though she is young and he is older. She is 22 with two small children, while he is over 40. They get along well as a couple.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Then a man named Alyohin comes to stay in their home. While he does not do anything directly wrong, his presence causes problems. Mrs. Luganovich starts to worry a lot and feels very sad. Her strong emotions for Alyohin destroy her relationship with her husband. In the end, she has mental health issues and breaks up with Alyohin, showing how an outsider can disrupt a marriage without meaning to.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Mrs. Baroda makes an expectation about Gouvernail even before meeting him. Suppose you are a mature girl/boy and your family members are giving you pressure to get married. Write in about 200 words describing what qualities you would like to get in your future husband/wife.</strong></p> <p><span>If my parents make me convinced to do wedding, this is what I look for in my wife:</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Ability to do chores: My mother does most of the housekeeping, from laundry to cooking. I want her to be helping me and mother since I don't always have time. We should assign duties depending on our workload.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Empathetic Nature: It's important for my future spouse to be empathetic and understanding, offering emotional support and comfort when needed.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Courage: Life has its challenges, and I want a partner who is brave enough to face them alongside me.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Intelligence: I value a partner who is intelligent and can collaborate with me to overcome obstacles in life, whether it's managing finances or pursuing our career goals.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Love and Faithfulness: Above all, I seek a partner who loves and remains faithful to me.</p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

How did the morning papers bring an ambiance of celebration in the Varma family?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>The morning paper brought an ambiance of celebration to the Varma family&nbsp;</span>because the newspaper showed that Rakesh did really well in his studies. He got the highest grade, and he was ranked first in the country.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. How did the community celebrate Rakesh’s success?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The community celebrated Rakesh's success by coming to the Varma family's small yellow house. They said congrats to Rakesh's parents for their son's success, patted Rakesh on the back, and made the house and garden feel like a big party. There were flowers, sweets (halwa), fancy clothes, and gifts, making it a fun celebration.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Why was Rakesh’s success a special matter of discussion in the neighbourhood?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>People in the neighborhood thought Rakesh's success was special because he was the first son in his family to go to school and college. His family had to make big sacrifices to send him to school, and his success made everyone proud and happy in the family and the neighborhood.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. How does the author make fun with the words ‘America’ and ‘the USA’?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The author has made fun with the words 'America' and 'the USA' by showing how Rakesh's family calls it \"the USA,\" which sounds more important, while the ignorant neighbors just call it \"America,\" which is simpler.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. How does the author characterize Rakesh’s wife?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The author describes Rakesh's wife as chubby and uneducated but also calm, agreeable, and traditional. She was chosen from the same village as Rakesh's mother's childhood friend, not from abroad like some Indian boys who marry foreign wives.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. Describe how Rakesh rises in his career.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Rakesh rises in his career by excelling in his medical studies, winning a scholarship, and going to the USA for further training. He eventually returns to set up his own clinic and becomes known as the best and richest doctor in town.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. How does the author describe Rakesh’s family background?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The author describes Rakesh's family background as humble. His father worked at a kerosene dealer's depot, and his mother spent her life in a kitchen. They were not well-educated, and Rakesh's success was seen as a significant achievement given their background.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. What is the impact of Rakesh’s mother’s death on his father?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Rakesh's father was deeply affected by the loss of his wife. He felt very lonely because no one could care for him the way his wife did. This made him feel sad, and it started to have a negative impact on his health.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>i. What did Rakesh do to make his father’s old age more comfortable?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>To make his father's old age more comfortable, Rakesh took care of him diligently. He brought his father morning tea, arranged for him to spend time in the garden for fresh air, supervised his diet, and provided best medical care.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>j. Why did the old man try to bribe his grandchildren?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>The old man bribed his grandchildrens to buy sweets for him because&nbsp;</span>he missed the tasty food his wife used to make, and he wanted to eat sweets, even though he wasn't allowed due to his diet.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>k. Are Mr. Varma’s complaints about his diets reasonable? How?</strong></p> <p><span>Mr. Varma’s complaints about his diets are reasonable. H</span>e wanted to eat his favorite foods and enjoy traditional dishes. However, Rakesh restricted his diet to keep him healthy and prevent further illnesses from a medical perspective.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference to the context&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>a. How did Varma couples make sacrifices for their son’s higher education?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The Varma family worked very hard to pay for their son Rakesh's further education. Mr. Varma could not go to school himself, but he wanted Rakesh to study. So for 40 years, Mr. Varma worked in a kerosene warehouse while Mrs. Varma took care of the home. They saved their money so Rakesh could go to college. Their sacrifices paid off when Rakesh became the first in their family to graduate from college.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Mr. Varma suffers from diseases one after another after his wife’s death. Would he have enjoyed better health if she had not died before him? Give reasons.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>Yes, Mrs. Verma's existence would have improved Mr. Varma's health. Rakesh was happy and busy in his own lifestyle. So, no one could care for his father like his mother did. When his wife died, he was left alone.&nbsp;</span>Her presence may have provided emotional support and care that could have positively impacted his well-being. The loss of his wife likely contributed to his declining health due to loneliness and emotional distress.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Dr. Rakesh is divided between a doctor and a son. As a son, he loves his father and worries about his weakening health but as a doctor he is strict on his father’s diet and medicine. In your view, what else could Rakesh have done to make his father’s final years more comfortable?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>To make his father's final years more comfortable, Rakesh could have shown more empathy and understanding as a son. While it's essential to consider his father's health from a medical perspective, he could have also balanced it with emotional support, allowing his father to enjoy occasional treats and traditional foods within moderation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. What does the story say about the relationship between grandfather and grandchildren?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The story shows that Mr. Varma had a close bond with his grandchildren. He liked spending time playing with them. His grandchildren were his closest friends since he felt lonely after his wife died. The grandchildren brought Mr. Varma happiness during his final years.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. Do you call Rakesh a devoted son? Give reasons.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>=&nbsp;</strong><span>Yes, I call Rakesh absolutely a devoted son. I have following reason to claim my opinion;&nbsp;</span></p> <ol>     <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"><span>After successfully completing studies in the US, He rejects the golden job opportunities there and returns to homeland to continue his job along with continuing to serve and take care for parents.</span></li>     <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"><span>Instead of marrying, an educated women, he marries illiterate rural women, so that she could give time to Rakesh's parent.</span></li>     <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"><span>Till the last breath of his mother, Rakesh was the one who held her hands and did everything he could do to save his mother.</span></li>     <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"><span>Being a doctor and &amp; owning a family, Rakesh had a very tight schedule, still he manages to take care of his father.</span></li>     <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"><span>When father fell ill, he banned oily foods for him, because they were not healthy for him, spent most of his time with father, brought high-quality and effective tonics and medicines, behaved humbly and paid respect every time and did his best efforts possible to give him longer span.&nbsp;</span></li> </ol> <p><span>Thus, as the title suggests, Rakesh is undoubtedly a devoted son.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference beyond the text&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>a.

Parents invest a significant amount of their income in their children's education, whether it's by enrolling them in good schools or providing them with extra tutoring. They wake up early every morning to ensure their children are prepared for school and create a suitable environment for studying.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Parents recognize their children's talents and interests and help them nurture those skills. For example, if a child shows musical talent, parents may enroll them in music lessons. If a child excels in sports, parents encourage their participation in athletic activities.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Parents emphasize the importance of moral values such as honesty, integrity, and respect. Through daily interactions and guidance, they teach their children the difference between right and wrong, aiming to raise responsible individuals.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Parents make significant financial sacrifices for their children's higher education. They save money for years, take loans, or even sell property to fund their children's college or university education. They are determined to provide their children with access to higher education and the opportunities it brings.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Parents prioritize their children's well-being and happiness above all else. They celebrate their children's achievements, big or small, and offer emotional support during difficult times. Whether it's receiving a school award or accomplishing something simple, parents are there to cheer their children on, boosting their confidence and motivation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In conclusion, parents in Nepali society have ambitious aspirations for their children. They show their commitment through their dedication to education, talent development, moral upbringing, financial sacrifices, and emotional support. This parental ambition shapes the lives of Nepali children, empowering them to strive for success and make positive contributions to society. The bond between parents and children is a crucial aspect of Nepali culture, and it is this ambition that continues to drive progress and growth in the nation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Medicines replace our diets in old age. What can be done to make old age less dependent on medicine?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>=&nbsp;</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Here are some things that can be done to make old age less dependent on medicine:</p> <ol>     <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">Nutritious Diet - Ensuring elders have access to a balanced and nutritious diet that meets their dietary needs. A proper diet can help manage many health issues.</li>     <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">Physical Activity - Encouraging and enabling regular physical activity like walking, yoga, swimming etc. according to one's mobility and health condition. Exercise can keep both body and mind active.</li>     <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">Social Interaction - Reducing isolation and loneliness by promoting social interaction through involvement in family/community activities. Social support improves mental well-being.</li>     <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">Disease Prevention - Conducting regular health checkups and awareness programs on lifestyle diseases common in old age like diabetes, hypertension, etc. and their prevention.</li>     <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">Traditional Medicines - Exploring benefits of complementary therapies like Ayurveda, yoga, naturopathy along with allopathic treatment to address age-related health issues holistically.</li>     <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">Positive Living - Cultivating positive attitudes towards aging through counseling and empowering elders to remain independent and engaged in routine activities of daily living.</li> </ol> <p>Adopting a wellness approach focusing on non-medical aspects can substantially reduce dependence on medicines during old age.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Write an essay on “Care of Elderly Citizens” in about 300 words.</strong></p> <p><strong>=</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>&nbsp;Care of Elderly Citizens</strong></p> <p>As more people live longer due to advancements in healthcare and medicine, caring for the elderly population has become a major issue. Elders deserve to live their later years with dignity and respect. As a society, we need to ensure our parents and grandparents receive proper care, financial support, healthcare, companionship and a nurturing environment as they age.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Caring for the elderly should not be left solely to family members. It requires a community effort. Governments must allocate adequate funding for elderly care facilities, retirement homes, assisted living options and home healthcare services. Medical facilities need to have geriatric specialists and units catering to senior citizens. Basic amenities like wheelchair access, larger signage and help counters should be standard in public places. Pension plans and universal healthcare also help the elderly population meet their daily needs.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Community organizations can play a vital role too through volunteer-run daycare centers, recreational activities, meal delivery programs and transportation services for medical visits. Simply visiting and spending time with elders who live alone can significantly improve their quality of life. Families must make time to care for aging parents and provide emotional support. Where possible, multigenerational living can offer practical and financial benefits as well as companionship for seniors.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As a society, we must foster a culture of respect, compassion and caring for our elderly. They have spent their lives contributing to society and building the world we live in today. Caring for them with dignity in their retirement years is the least we can do to show our gratitude for their dedicated service and hard work. Aging gracefully is a right for all.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1. Subscribe to our YouTube Channel - 'The SR Zone'.</p><p>2.

      "story": "<p><span>The Treasure in The forest</span></p> <p><br /></p><p>Written by Shriram Lamichhane | © The SR Zone</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Understanding the text</strong></p> <p><strong>Answer the following questions.</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Describe the expository scene of the story.</strong></p> <p><span>In the expository scene of the story, we see two characters, Evans and Hooker, sailing in the boat, holding a map in hand, and were seen confused as they did not understand the map. They were approaching a land nearby, which was a dense forest.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. What does the map look like and how do Evan and Hooker interpret it?</strong></p> <p><span>The map was a little bit torn, and since it was older, the paper was also unclear. Somehow, they succeed in decoding the symbols in the map. They make their destination to the dotted lines area, which according to them, is the place where the treasure was hidden.</span></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>c. How did Evan and Hooker know about the treasure?</strong></p> <p><span>Evan and Hooker had known about the treasure that was buried and protected by Chang-hi in a secret place while the Chinese man was having the chit chat with his three friends in the jungle</span> in broken English<span>. According to their conversation, Once,&nbsp;</span>Chang-hi discovered a buried treasure. He decided to re-bury it, planning to come back for it later. However, he needed help to carry the treasure, so he was asking for helwith his fellow friends.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Describe Evan’s dream.</strong></p> <p>Evan was daydreaming while on his boat. He had a strange dream. In his dream, he saw himself and his friend Hooker in a forest. They were looking for something. Evan heard three Chinese men talking in the forest. The men were talking about treasure hidden in the forest. Evan's friends moved closer to listen better. One Chinese man was telling them about treasure that he hid in the forest and now wants to work in a team to retrieve that.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In the dream, Evan saw the Chinese men fighting. Chang-hi was killed in the battle. After a silent pause, Chang-hi suddenly started laughing loudly. Evan then saw a big devil-like version of Chang-hi. It had a large black tail and was sitting in a pile of gold coins. The devil Chang-hi was calling Evan's name.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. What do the two treasure hunters see when they walk towards the island?</strong></p> <p>The treasure hunters Evans and Hooker were exploring the jungle. They came across a small clearing with three palm trees. Many plants were growing there. In the middle of the plants they saw a dead body lying face down on the grass. It was the body of a Chinese man.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. In what condition did the treasure hunters find the dead man?</strong></p> <p>The treasure hunters found the dead man lying face down on the ground in a clear space among the trees. The dead man was a Chinaman, and his body showed signs of a poisoned state or a snakebite. He had a purple neck, swollen hands, and ankles.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. How did the treasure hunters try to carry gold ingots to the canoe?</strong></p> <p>The treasure hunters tried to carry the gold ingots by placing them in a coat. They lifted the coat, with the ingots inside, and attempted to carry it towards their canoe.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. How were Evan and Hooker poisoned?</strong></p> <p><span>Chang-Hi had protected his treasure with poisonous thorns as indicated in the map with Dashes(---).&nbsp;</span>Evan was pricked by a thorn, and Hooker was also pricked on his thumb. These thorns were similar to those used by the Dyaks for poison in their blowing-tubes. The poison from the thorns caused severe symptoms, including pain and paralysis, which affected both men.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference to the context</strong></p> <p><strong>a. How do you know the story is set on a tropical island?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>The story is set on a tropical island because the passage describes the vegetation like palms, thorny plants and seagrass which are commonly found on tropical islands. It also mentions that the characters seemed weary and thirsty due to the long night journey and intense heat, which shows that the island has a hot climate like tropical islands.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Why do you think Evan and Hooker took such a risk of finding the buried treasure on a desert island?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Evan and Hooker wanted to become rich so they took the risk of finding buried treasure on the deserted island. Being poor, they were probably desperate for money and saw this as a chance to improve their lives. Their greed led them to kill someone and break laws to find the treasure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Do you think the narrator of the story is racist? If yes, what made him feel superior to other races?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Yes, the narrator seems racist. He describes the English characters by name but refers to the Chinese man without even giving the definitive names. This shows he sees the English race as superior. Chinese man are also given very minor role. The way he tells the story also makes it look like the English characters are dominating and powerful than Chinese man.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. What do you think is the moral of the story?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>The moral of the story is that greed and pursuit of wealth and power often lead to bad consequences. Evan and Hooker were so focused on finding treasure that they disregarded laws and ethics, which ultimately led to their deaths. The story teaches us to avoid greed and think about long term goals and impacts of our actions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference Beyond Text</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Interpret the story as a mystery story.</strong></p> <p>The story's plot and characters can be interpreted as a mystery story. Some key elements of a mystery found in the story are:</p> <p><br /></p> <ul> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">It creates suspense by keeping the readers guessing about what will happen next.</li> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">The characters like Evans and Hooker are investigating clues given on the map to find the hidden treasure, making it similar to detectives solving a mystery.&nbsp;</li> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">The forest setting adds to the creepy and mysterious atmosphere.&nbsp;</li> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">There are plot twists and misdirections like the characters getting misled by the dashes on the map.&nbsp;</li> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">Unexpected and tragic events like the characters getting killed by poisonous thorns add surprises.&nbsp;</li> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">Pieces of clues and evidence given in the story need to be connected to understand fully like in any mystery story.</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Treasure hunting is a favorite subject of children’s stories. Remember a treasure hunting story you read in your childhood and compare and contrast it with ‘The Treasure in the Forest.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;I remember a treasure hunting story called \"The Hidden Treasure\" from my childhood. In this story, there was an old father with three idle sons who never helped him, causing him great sadness and worry. Despite his efforts, he couldn't change their behavior. When the father fell seriously ill, he gathered his sons and shared a secret with them. He revealed that there was a hidden treasure buried somewhere in their fields, but he had forgotten the exact location. He asked them to find it after his passing. Sadly, the father died two days later. The sons diligently searched every inch of the land but couldn't find anything. Eventually, someone suggested they sow wheat in the field, resulting in a bountiful harvest. The moral of the story was that hard work leads to fruitful outcomes.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Similar to \"The Treasure in the Forest,\" this childhood story also explores the theme of human greed for wealth. In both tales, characters are driven by their desire for treasure, prioritizing it over the well-being of others. Just as Chang-hi's death in our story reflects this greed, the sons in \"The Hidden Treasure\" display a similar attitude by valuing the treasure over their dying father.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

How does the narrator describe his feeling at the arrival of his old home?</strong></p> <p><strong>=&nbsp;</strong>The narrator feels mixed emotions of happiness, nostalgia and sadness upon returning to his old home. He is happy and nostalgic to see his beloved old home but also sad knowing he has to leave it forever. <span>When the narrator realizes that nothing has changed around him, he becomes nervous. He's been expecting development in his hometown.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. What were the three kinds of servants in China then? What does it indicate about contemporary Chinese society?</strong></p> <p><strong>=&nbsp;</strong>There were three types of servants in old China - day workers who only worked for a day, yearlong servants who worked for the same family all year, and busy-mothers who worked seasonally during festivals or when rent was due. This indicates China had a class system that divided work based on social status.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. What makes the narrator nostalgic? What did he do with Runtu in his teenage years?</strong></p> <p><strong>=</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>The narrator feels nostalgic when his mother asks him to meet his old friend Runtu, as he spent a lot of fun time playing in fields with Runtu during his teenage years.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. How did Runtu hunt a Zha in his young age?</strong></p> <p><strong>=&nbsp;</strong>Runtu used to protect watermelons from a creature called Zha by standing guard on the beach. He fiercely attacked a Zha with his knife using all his young strength.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. How does the narrator make a humorous picture of Mrs. Yang?</strong></p> <p><strong>=&nbsp;</strong>The narrator humorously describes Mrs. Yang's face as resembling two compasses in a geometry box due to her narrow cheekbones and lips. He recalls her nickname \"Beancurd Beauty\" which attracted many customers to the shop.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. According to the narrator, what were different factors that made Runtu a poor man throughout his life?</strong></p> <p><span>=&nbsp;</span>Factors like social divisions, high taxes, family obligations, discrimination, lack of opportunities and very poor economic background kept Runtu poor throughout his life.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. How does the narrator help Runtu before leaving the old home?</strong></p> <p><span>=&nbsp;</span>Before leaving his old home, the narrator helps his poor friend Runtu by giving him some basic furniture and items like tables, candles, incense burner and scales.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. How does the author differentiate two kinds of idols?</strong></p> <p><span>= The two idols that are mentioned in the story are superstitious idols and hope. He distinguishes between these two types of idols, stating that people worship superstitious idols for the short term benefits because they want something immediately, while hope is a long-term, uncertain and unclear.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference to the context</strong></p> <p><strong>a. While reading the friendship between the narrator and Runtu, Hindu readers remember the friendship between Krishna and Sudama. Which particular description reminds you of the mythological example?</strong></p> <p>The story of the narrator's connection with Runtu reminds Hindu readers of the relationship between Krishna and Sudama.</p> <p><br /></p> <ul> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">Krishna and Sudama were good friends from childhood, just like the narrator and Runtu in this story.</li> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">Runtu is poor, like Krishna's friend Sudhama was poor.</li> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">Sudhama felt embarrassed when visiting Krishna, and Runtu also felt shy during his visit to Xun.</li> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">When Sudhama visited, Krishna welcomed him warmly to his palace. Similarly, when Runtu visited Xun, Xun greeted him warmly.</li> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">In the end, Lu Xun helped Runtu by providing food, just as Krishna helped Sudama by making his hut nice with everything he needed.</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>Both stories show that \"A friend in need is a true friend\". A real friendship is not affected by how much money or possessions someone has.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. How does the story support the proposition that the relationships of childhood are innocent, impartial and disinterested?</strong></p> <p>The story supports the idea that childhood friendships are innocent, fair, and not interested in status or money. It uses the example of Runtu and the narrator's close friendship.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Lu Shun was Runtu's master, but the story shows their friendship was pure, neutral and not focused on their roles. They interacted as equals without caring about worker and master. Their bond went beyond social divisions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As children, they had fun together and freely shared their thoughts. They didn't notice or care about supposed social class differences. They treated each other fairly without bias. They treasured the innocence of their childhood. The story only shows their real friendship.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Most childhood friendships have similar qualities. Childhood is the first phase of life, and whatever we do during that time stays with us forever in our memories until we die. Friendships from childhood are always very pure, innocent and unforgettable too. Young friends have a close bond with each other.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. After reading the story, what inferences can you make about the contemporary Chinese economic and social system?</strong></p> <p>In \"My Old Home,\" we find out that poor farmers and farm workers had complex relationships. Back then, people with different levels of money and social status couldn't easily become friends. Runtu was poor, and Lu Xun came from a middle-class family. Society's rules didn't allow them to be friends because they were from different backgrounds. The story also talks about slavery and how people were divided into full-time, part-time, and year-round servants.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The story also shows how peasants were mistreated and how they were unhappy with the feudal system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. What does the story indicate about the geographical features of the narrator’s hometown?</strong></p> <p>In the story, the narrator talks about how beautiful their hometown used to be. The narrator and their friend Runtu had a great time there. Back then, the place had lots of green plants. Watermelons grew by the ocean, making the sandy beach look even prettier. The town was calm and fun.</p> <p>But when the narrator returns home twenty years later, they see that things have not improved. The place is now sad and empty, and the seaside town is deserted. The narrator feels really upset to see the place so empty and isolated.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference beyond the text</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Human beings are on the road from time immemorial, always migrating to new places. Write an essay on The Trend of Migration in Nepal in about 300 words.</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Trend of Migration in Nepal</strong></p> <p>Title: The Trend of Migration in Nepal</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Introduction:</p> <p>Migration has been an integral part of human history, with people constantly on the move in search of better opportunities and improved living conditions. Nepal, a landlocked country in South Asia, has witnessed a significant trend of migration throughout its history. This essay explores the causes, patterns, and impacts of migration in Nepal.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Causes of Migration:</p> <p>Several factors contribute to the trend of migration in Nepal. Economic reasons play a crucial role, with individuals seeking better employment opportunities, higher wages, and improved living standards. Limited job prospects, poverty, and lack of economic development in rural areas often push people to migrate to urban centers or overseas destinations. Additionally, political instability, social conflicts, and natural disasters can also trigger migration as people strive for safety and security.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Patterns of Migration:</p> <p>Nepal experiences both internal and external migration. Internal migration refers to movement within the country, primarily from rural to urban areas. Rapid urbanization, coupled with the concentration of educational and employment opportunities in urban centers, attracts a large number of migrants from rural areas. Kathmandu, the capital city, serves as a major magnet for internal migrants. External migration involves Nepali citizens seeking employment and better livelihoods abroad, particularly in the Gulf countries, Malaysia, and other Southeast Asian nations.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Impacts of Migration:</p> <p>Migration has both positive and negative impacts on Nepal. Remittances sent by Nepali migrant workers contribute significantly to the country's economy. These funds help alleviate poverty, improve living standards, and boost investment in education and healthcare. Moreover, return migrants often bring back new skills, knowledge, and experiences that can contribute to the overall development of the country. On the other hand, migration also poses challenges such as brain drain, as skilled professionals seek opportunities abroad, leaving gaps in critical sectors like healthcare and education. Social consequences, including the separation of families and strain on traditional values and cultural practices, are also observed.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Government Initiatives:</p> <p>Recognizing the importance of migration, the Nepali government has taken various measures to address its challenges and harness its benefits. Efforts have been made to enhance skill development programs to equip potential migrants with the necessary qualifications and training. The government has also established mechanisms to protect the rights and welfare of migrant workers abroad through bilateral agreements and diplomatic channels. Additionally, there is an increasing focus on rural development, job creation, and economic diversification to curb the outflow of migrants from rural areas.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Conclusion:</p> <p>Migration has become a significant trend in Nepal, driven by economic, political, and social factors. While it presents opportunities for economic growth and development, it also poses challenges that need to be addressed. By implementing effective policies, promoting sustainable development, and safeguarding the rights of migrants, Nepal can harness the potential benefits of migration while mitigating its negative consequences.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Find one of your relatives or friends, who has migrated to a new place leaving his/her old home. Talk to him/her and prepare a report on what he/she felt while leaving the old home.</strong></p> <p>Introduction: I interviewed my friend Maya, who recently migrated from Nepal to Canada, to understand her emotions, challenges, and experiences associated with this major life transition.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Background: Maya, a 22-year-old professional, chose to leave her hometown in Nepal seeking better career prospects and a higher quality of life in Canada. This required leaving behind her family, friends, and the comfort of her familiar surroundings to start fresh in a new country.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Emotional Impact: Maya expressed mixed feelings about leaving her old home. While excited by new possibilities abroad, she also felt sadness parting from loved ones and places important to her. Saying goodbye to parents was especially difficult.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Challenges: Adapting to an unfamiliar environment without a support system initially posed challenges. The language barrier hindered communication and integration into Canadian society. Securing housing, understanding local customs, and navigating immigration complicated matters further.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>New Beginnings: Despite difficulties, Maya maintained hope and optimism for her new chapter. She valued personal and professional growth opportunities, broadening horizons, and cultural exposure. Continued family support encouraged pursuit of dreams during the transition.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Conclusion: Maya's experience reflects complex emotions of significant change. While facing hurdles, her determination, resilience and positivity helped navigate difficulties. Her story highlights strength needed to leave familiarity for new beginnings leading to growth.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

According to the tourist, why is the West indebted to the East?</strong></p> <p><span>=&nbsp;</span>According to the tourist, the West owes a debt to the East because the East has given the West various valuable things, including ancient texts like the Puranas, brass sculptures, ivory decorations, palm-leaf manuscripts, copperplate inscriptions, and most importantly, a rich and sacred civilization.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c.

Shiva shrine is a hindu temple, but there are numerous Buddha statues and several prayer wheels with ‘Om mani padme hum’ written on them on the premise of the main temple as well. C</span>hildren from different backgrounds play happily there together.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. Why does the guide take the tourist to the remote village?</strong></p> <p><span>= &nbsp;</span>The guide takes the tourist to a remote village to show the reality of rural Nepali life through the eyes of a poor, paralyzed child and teach the tourist about people's hardships and struggles in rural part of Nepal.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. What does the innocent village couple think of the doctor?</strong></p> <p><span>= &nbsp;The innocent village couple believes the tourist to be their oldest son, who has come to give the brother a life-restoring medicine from the seven seas.

Which narrative technique is used by the author to tell the story? How is this story different from other stories you have read?</strong></p> <p><span>=&nbsp;</span>The author, Shankar Lamichhane, tells a story using a style of writing called stream of consciousness. This style is different from regular stories. In a regular story, there is a straightforward story. In stream of consciousness, you are inside the character's mind. You experience their thoughts as they happen.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>You can see the character's thoughts flowing. The story dives into what the character sees and feels. There may be repeating ideas or unusual grammar. This helps you understand what is happening in the character's head.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>What is neat about this style is how the thoughts just flow like a river. The story is told from the view of a person exploring Kathmandu Valley. Instead of focusing on events, it focuses on the character's thoughts and feelings. This gives you a different way to connect with the story.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. How is the author able to integrate two fragments of the narration into a unified whole?</strong></p> <p><span>=&nbsp;</span>In the short story \"The Half-closed Eyes of the Buddha and the Slowly Sinking Sun,\" the author tries to connect two different stories by using the theme of \"eyes.\" The tourist in the story sees only the positive side of the country, while the guide is aware of both the positive and negative aspects of the country.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>By bringing two parts of the story together with \"eyes\", author shows how eyes can mean different things in different situations.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The author does this by sharing examples of things that happen in different communities, what people do, the challenges they face, and even illnesses. By talking about all these things, the author connects them to the idea of \"eyes\" and what they symbolize.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The author uses a writing style called \"stream of consciousness\" to get this message across. This means the author shares thoughts as they come, without a strict order. It helps us understand the different meanings of \"eyes\" in various places and situations.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. The author brings some historical and legendary references in the story. Collect these references and show their significance in the story.</strong></p> <p>The story \"The Half-Closed Eyes of the Buddha and the Slowly Sinking Sun\" includes many historical and legendary references. These references are important to understand the story.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The story talks about the Puranas, brass sculptures, ivory sculptures, palm leaf manuscripts, and copperplate inscriptions. These represent Nepal's rich cultural heritage. Gautam Buddha's eyes are portrayed with the beautiful sunset. This depicts Nepal as a land of hope and peace. The Bhikshus symbolize having a true perspective of reality. The overflowing Bagmati River refers to the legend of Manjushree making the Kathmandu Valley habitable for humans. The Adinath temple represents Nepal's tolerance and unity between different beliefs. The story briefly mentions Princess Bhrikuti and King Amshuvarma. This highlights Nepal's past connections to Tibet through relationships.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In total, these historical and legendary references provide meaning and context to appreciate the story better.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. The author talks about the eyes in many places: the eyes of the shaven monks and nuns, eyes in the window and door panels, the eyes of the Himalayas, the eyes of the paralyzed boy, the eyes of the welcoming villagers and above all the half-closed eyes of the Buddha. Explain how all the instances of eyes contribute to the overall unity of the story.</strong></p> <p><span>=</span>Throughout the story, the author mentions different instances of eyes, like the shaven monks and nuns, eyes in windows and doors, the eyes of the Himalayas, the eyes of the paralyzed boy, the eyes of the welcoming villagers, and the half-closed eyes of the Buddha. These eyes are a central theme in the story.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>These eyes represent something deeper. They symbolize different perspectives, experiences, and ways of seeing the world. Each pair of eyes has its own unique story and viewpoint, showing the diverse culture of Nepal.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The half-closed eyes of the Buddha are especially important. They represent calmness, wisdom, and acceptance. The Buddha's watchful gaze unites the land and its people, giving guidance and a sense of togetherness. The Buddha's eyes bring together all the different perspectives and experiences in the story.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In conclusion, these mentions of eyes in the story show how diverse and connected human experiences and viewpoints are in Nepal's cultural and natural landscape.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference beyond the text</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Write an essay on Living Proximity to Nature.</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>&nbsp;Living Proximity (nearer) to Nature : An Essay</strong></p> <p>Living in proximity to nature has numerous benefits for human well-being and happiness. Being surrounded by trees, plants and natural spaces allows people to feel more connected to the environment. It reduces stress and promotes relaxation. Just viewing nature scenes like forests or parks has been shown to lower blood pressure and the production of cortisol, the stress hormone.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Those who live close to parks, trails or other green spaces also tend to be more active. The easy accessibility encourages people to go for walks, runs or hikes more regularly. This helps combat obesity and diseases related to physical inactivity. Nature exposure also improves cognitive performance. Students who live near green spaces report better concentration and academic achievement.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>With urbanization, many communities lack sufficient natural landscapes. But efforts should be made to incorporate more trees and vegetation even in cities. Pocket parks, community gardens and protected natural buffers improve quality of life. Governments should focus on accessible and well-maintained recreational areas for improved public health outcomes. Living near nature provides numerous psychological and physical benefits that enhance general well-being.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. The story talks about ethnic/religious co-existence of different communities in Nepal, where the Buddhists and the Hindus and the Aryans and non-Aryans have lived in communal harmony for ages. In your view, how have the Nepali people been able to live in such harmony?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>In Nepal, the coexistence of different ethnic and religious communities is possible because of a few key reasons:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Shared Beliefs: Many communities in Nepal worship the same deities. This common spiritual connection helps create a sense of unity and shared identity among diverse groups.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Historical Acceptance: Nepal has a history of accepting various religions and cultures. Instead of suppressing diversity, the country has embraced it over the years.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Secular Constitution: Nepal's constitution declares the country as secular and guarantees religious freedom. This legal framework ensures that people can practice their religion without facing discrimination.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Geographical Factors: Nepal's geography, with its isolated communities in remote areas, has helped preserve diverse cultural and religious practices. It has allowed different groups to maintain their traditions without external interference.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Cultural Exchange: The coexistence of different communities in Nepal has led to a rich cultural exchange. People have learned from each other's traditions, promoting understanding and harmony.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>These factors have allowed diverse groups to peacefully coexist and thrive in this beautiful country.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

Guide shows the visitor from the west different parts around Kathmandu, Nepal.</p><p><br /></p><p>As they travel through beautiful Nepali valleys, the visitor is amazed by the landscapes, culture and history. The guide has known Nepalese beauty in library books only all his life. The guide says plains in the West make people feel small. But Nepal's hills provide a feeling of comfort and safety.</p><p><br /></p><p>The guide talks about how Nepal has given many things to the West over centuries. Things like religion, art, books and culture. Yet Nepal continues giving without wanting anything back.</p><p><br /></p><p>Over drinks in the evening, the guest discusses various aspects of Nepali history and culture he learned about in research before his visit. They talk about ancient sites, legendary kings, monks and nuns like &nbsp;Tibetan Bhikshu who made kathmandu habitable, and artistic traditions. The guest is impressed by the religious and cultural diversity that has flourished peacefully in Nepal.</p><p><br /></p><p>For dinner, the guide serves typical Nepali and Newari cuisine like momos. This sparks discussion of rural cultural traditions, family scenes, and the transmission of culture through generations. The guide emphasizes things that cannot truly be understood from books alone.</p><p><br /></p><p>The next day, seeking to fulfill his promise to show the requested \"eyes\", the guide takes the guest to Chobhar hill. There, in a village temple courtyard, they find a shrine of Shiva alongside Buddha images and prayer wheels inscribed with \"Om mani padme hum.\"&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The guide points out that this represents a living example of Nepal's religious tolerance and coexistence, with multiple faiths and deities worshipped side by side in the same space.

There, the guide reflects profoundly on the child's condition and what it represents.</p><p><br /></p><p>The guide sees the child's eyes look empty, with no expression or involvement. Yet he survives with no complaints, showing eastern acceptance. The family happily meets the visitor thinking he is a doctor to help.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>In a moving internal monologue, the guide imagines the child wishing he could learn, experience life, speak and participate as his actively exploring sister does. His condition represents the \"end\" of historical progression and development.</p><p><br /></p><p>The story uses this troubling scene to discuss philosophy, endurance, and what cannot be captured in books alone about Nepal - conveying the depths of human experience and providing a profound conclusion to the guest's cultural journey.</p> <p><br /></p> "

How does the narrator describe the weather and its effects in the exposition of the story?</strong></p> <p>The narrator describes the weather as dark and gloomy. It had been raining for days, making the soil muddy. The rain had caused crabs to come into the house, and the family believed it was making their sick child even sicker.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Describe the strange old man as Palayo and his wife first encounter within their courtyard.</strong></p> <p>When Pelayo and his wife Elisenda first encounter the strange old man in their courtyard, he is described as lying face down in the mud. He has enormous wings that are dirty and half-plucked, and he looks like an old, ragged man with very few hairs left on his bald head and very few teeth in his mouth.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Why did Pelayo and Elisenda imprison the old man in the chicken coop?</strong></p> <p>Pelayo and Elisenda put the old man in the chicken coop because they thought he might be a threat to their baby. They believed he was an angel who came for the child, and they wanted to keep him away to protect their family.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Why was Father Gonzaga not sure about the old man being a celestial messenger?</strong></p> <p>Father Gonzaga was not sure about the old man being a celestial messenger because the old man didn't understand Latin, the language of God's ministers, and didn't respond in a way that would be expected of an angel.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. Many people gathered at Pelayo's house to see the strange old man. Why do you think the crowd assembled to see him?</strong></p> <p>Many people came to Pelayo's house to see the strange old man because his big wings made him look very different and interesting. Some thought he might be special angel or sent by God, while others just wanted to see him. They were all curious about who he was.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. Some miracles happened while the crowd gathered to see the strange man. What are these miracles?</strong></p> <p>Some miracles happened while the crowd gathered to see the strange man. For example, a blind man didn't regain his sight but grew three new teeth, a paralytic didn't start walking but almost won the lottery, and a leper's sores sprouted sunflowers.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. State the irritating things that the people did with the strange old man.</strong></p> <p>The people did several irritating things with the strange old man, including throwing things at him, plucking his feathers trying to get him to stand up, and even burning him with an iron. They treated him like a circus animal.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. How and why was the woman changed into a spider?</strong></p> <p>The woman who was changed into a spider was originally a disobedient child. She had gone to a dance without her parents' permission, and during a thunderstorm, she was struck by lightning, which turned her into a giant spider.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>i. Describe how Elisenda saw the strange man flying over the houses.</strong></p> <p>Elisenda watched the strange man when he tried to fly away. At first, he didn't fly very well and had trouble staying up in the air. But then, he got higher and eventually flew away. Elisenda kept looking until he became a tiny dot far away over the sea.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference to the context</strong></p> <p><strong>a. The arrival of a strange old man at Palayo’s courtyard arouses many suspicions and explanations. Explain how the neighbour woman, Father Gonzaga and the doctor speak of the strange man. Why do you think these three people give three different kinds of interpretations?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>When a strange old man appears in Palayo's courtyard, it raises suspicions and leads to different explanations from the neighbor lady, Father Gonzaga, and the doctor. These three people give different interpretations because they have different beliefs and backgrounds. Additionally, the old man's appearance and actions were so unusual and unlike anything they had seen before. He had wings and spoke in an unknown language, making it difficult for them to agree on a single theory.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The neighbor lady, who considered herself knowledgeable about life and death, believed the old man was an angel sent to take the child but was unable to do so because of the rain and his old age. Father Gonzaga, the priest, suspected the old man might be a fake angel since he couldn't understand the language of God. The doctor, upon discovering the old man's natural wings and hearing a whistling sound in his heart and kidneys, was amazed and questioned why he was the only one born with such features. Their different explanations stemmed from their limited understanding of who the old man really was.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. This story belongs to the genre of ‘magical realism’, a genre perfected by Gabriel Garcia Marquez in his novels and short stories. Magical realism is a narrative technique in which the story-teller narrates the commonplace things with magical colour and the events look both magical and real at the same time. Collect five magic realist happenings from the story and argue why they seem magical to you.</strong></p> <p><span>Magical realism (Magic + Real) is a storytelling method where the storyteller paints ordinary objects in a fantastic light, making them seem both magical and real.&nbsp;</span>In this story, strange things occur that are not normal in our everyday lives. <span>Title itself \"A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings\" depicts magical realism. A very old man is a real life existence and man with wings is a supernatural figure or a creature from a mythological world. In addition to this, the following instances are a few which make this story more magical to the readers like me;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <ol> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">According to the neighbor, the old man is an angel who has come to take the sick child to paradise. This idea involves something magical happening in our real world.</li> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">&nbsp;When the old man with huge wings arrives in the courtyard, it's a magical moment. His presence is extraordinary and seems like something from another world. It's not something you see every day.</li> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">The fact that the old man has wings is magical. Humans don't usually have wings, so it adds a touch of wonder and magic to the story.</li> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">The strange healings that happen when people visit the old man, like a blind man growing new teeth or sores turning into sunflowers, are magical.&nbsp;</li> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">The story introduces a woman who transforms into a giant spider, which is a magical event. It's not something that happens in the real world, and it blurs the line between reality and fantasy.</li> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">When the old man tries to fly away, his initial clumsiness and then his ability to fly over the sea are magical. It goes against the laws of physics and fills the story with wonder.</li> </ol> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Because of this, this story also falls under the umbrella of 'magical realism.'&nbsp;</span>These things are not typical but they happen within the story's world.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. The author introduces the episode of a woman who became a spider for having disobeyed her parents. This episode at once shifts people’s concentration from the strange old man to the spider woman. What do you think is the purpose of the author to bring this shift in the story?</strong></p> <p>The author changed the story to highlight how people often ignore mysterious, thought-provoking and serious things. Instead of focusing on the strange old man, people become fascinated by the spider lady quickly.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>This change in people's interests suggests they prefer lighthearted and entertaining things over serious ones. The crowd embraces the lady who transformed into a spider, and the angel's appearance is forgotten. They find the spider lady more exciting and entertaining.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The author also shows how two seemingly unrelated events can be connected in a miraculous way. The story introduces a lady who becomes a spider after disobeying her parents, revealing a connection between her transformation and the appearance of the old man.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. The story deals with the common people’s gullibility. How do Palayo and his wife take advantage of common people’s whim?</strong></p> <p>Pelayo and his wife, Elisenda, take advantage of the common people's gullibility in the story by exploiting the curiosity and fascination surrounding the strange old man with wings. They recognize that the people are eager to see something extraordinary and are willing to pay for it.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Pelayo and Elisenda decide to charge five cents admission to see the old man with wings. With the money they earn from the visitors, Pelayo and Elisenda use it to build a two-story mansion with balconies and gardens. This demonstrates how they capitalize on the people's fascination with the old man to improve their own living conditions.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Pelayo and Elisenda take advantage of the common people's curiosity and gullibility by turning the old man with wings into a profitable attraction, prioritizing their own interests and financial gain over the well-being of the mysterious visitor.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference beyond the text</strong></p> <p><strong>a. An irresistible crowd queues at Palayo’s house for many days simply to look at the strange old man. Narrate an episode from your experience or from another story where people assemble in crowds, not for any noble cause.</strong></p> <p><span>An irresistible crowd queues at Palayo’s house for many days simply to look at the strange old man. In our town, similar incidents frequently take place, when a person gets injured in accidents. People, leaving their own business, start gathering and making a crowd just to see the accident, though there is no noble cause.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. The taste of children is different from grown-ups. What are the elements in the story that make ‘The Old Man with Enormous Wings’ a children’s story?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>\"The Old Man with Enormous Wings\" possesses elements that make it suitable for children:</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Fantasy and Magical Elements: Children are often drawn to stories with fantasy and magical elements.

Children's stories often include moral themes to impart values and lessons.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Fascination with the Unusual: Children are naturally curious about the unusual and the mysterious. The strange and fantastical elements in the story can pique a child's curiosity and sense of wonder.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Short Length: The story is relatively short, which is suitable for shorter attention spans typical of children. It can be read or told in one sitting, making it ideal for bedtime or storytelling.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Animal Characters: The story features animals like crabs and chickens, which are relatable and interesting to children.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Overall, \"The Old Man with Enormous Wings\" combines elements of fantasy, simplicity, visual imagery, moral lessons, and fascination with the unusual, making it a story that can resonate with and entertain children.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

"reward": "<p><b>Summary</b></p> <p>The story begins with a setting of continuous rain for several days, leading to a sad and gloomy atmosphere. Pelayo and his wife, Elisenda, have been dealing with a house full of crabs due to the heavy rain. They believe the crabs' presence is causing their newborn child to have a fever, so Pelayo throws the crabs into the sea.</p><p><br /></p><p>Pelayo discovers an old man with enormous, dirty wings lying face down in the mud in their courtyard. He is unable to get up and has huge, half-plucked wings tangled in the mud. Pelayo and Elisenda initially fear this strange sight but soon find the old man oddly familiar. They attempt to communicate with him, but he speaks an incomprehensible dialect. They conclude that he is a castaway from a shipwreck, and a wise neighbor woman suggests he might be an angel who was on a mission to take their sick child but got knocked down by the rain.</p><p><br /></p><p>Word of the captive angel spreads, and the entire town becomes curious. They decide not to harm the angel and, instead, charge people to see him in their courtyard. People from all around come to witness the angel. Some even suggest grand ideas like making him the mayor of the world or a five-star general.</p><p><br /></p><p>Father Gonzaga, the local priest, arrives and questions the authenticity of the angel, suspecting him to be an imposter. He observes the angel's behavior and language, which further raises doubts. He decides to seek guidance from higher authorities, delaying any decisive action.</p><p><br /></p><p>While waiting for the priest's response, the courtyard becomes a bustling attraction, with people coming to see the angel and making various inquiries. Elisenda and Pelayo start making a lot of money from the visitors. However, the angel remains passive and unresponsive to the crowd's attention.</p><p><br /></p><p>The situation changes when a woman who had been turned into a spider arrives in town as part of a traveling show. Her appearance and her tragic story overshadow the angel's presence. People flock to see her instead, and the angel is forgotten. Pelayo's courtyard returns to normalcy.</p><p><br /></p><p>Elisenda and Pelayo use the money they earned to build a luxurious house, complete with security measures to keep out both crabs and angels. They live a prosperous life, and their child grows up playing near the old chicken coop, where the angel had once been held. The angel's presence becomes a distant memory, and he gradually regains his strength. One day, he miraculously takes flight, and Elisenda watches him disappear into the horizon, leaving behind the life he had known as a captive in the courtyard.</p><p><br /></p> "

What does the line ‘The news like squirrels ran’ mean?</strong></p> <p><strong>=&nbsp;</strong><span>T</span>The line 'The news like squirrels ran' means that the information about the sunrise ( or simply rays of the sun) spread very quickly across the area, just like how squirrels can run very fast.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. What do you understand by the line ‘The hills untied their bonnets’?</strong></p> <p><strong>=</strong><span>&nbsp;Bonnets mean a special type of hat which can be tied under the chin.</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The line 'The hills untied their bonnets' refers to the hills losing their dark appearance as night ended. Before sunrise, the hills looked dark and gloomy like wearing a hat (bonnet). But when the sun's rays fell on the hills, their greenery and beauty was revealed as they seemed to remove their hats, becoming happy and excited.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Is the speaker watching the morning sun? Why? Why not?</strong></p> <p><strong>=</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>No, the speaker is not watching the morning sun. This is because he says \"I’ll tell you how the Sun rose\", meaning he is describing what happened after the sunrise. He is not narrating by watching it in real time.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. How does the sun set?</strong></p> <p>= The speaker does not know exactly how the sun sets. He only knows that the sun goes away taking all the happiness and joy, leaving behind unhappy and gloomy darkness. The slowly changing purple and yellow colors indicate that the sun is setting, but the speaker is unclear about the details of how it sets.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference to the context</strong></p> <p><strong>a. What, according to the speaker, is a day?</strong></p> <p>A day according to the speaker is a representation of life. It symbolizes sunrise as the beginning or birth of life and setting of sun as death. The time between birth and death is called \"day\" where we do various activities.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. What purpose does the hyphen in the first line serve in the poem?</strong></p> <p>The hyphen (-) indicates a pause or break. It allows the readers to think about the context and imagine the missing word.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. What makes this poem lyrical and sonorous? Discuss.</strong></p> <p>The poem has a musical quality due to the use of techniques like alliteration, assonance and rhythm. Being in first person, it expresses the poet's thoughts and feelings in a lyrical manner.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Who is the target audience of the speaker? Why?</strong></p> <p>The target audience includes both children and adults. Children can understand the literal meaning, while adults can interpret the metaphysical significance of life and death. It seems to be addressed to friends to describe the sunrise.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. The poem seems to describe a day for children. How would the adult people respond to this poem?</strong></p> <p>Adult people would be able to appreciate the deeper philosophical meaning behind the description of a day. While children see the literal depiction, adults can relate it to the various stages of human life from birth to death in a metaphysical sense. This poem encourages readers to think deeply and reflect upon the idea that life is temporary and impermanent.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference beyond the text</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Observe your surroundings one fine morning and write a poem based on your own experience.</strong></p> <p><strong>=</strong><span>&nbsp;You can write a Poem on your own.

The most important and special day for me was my first day of school. I was six years old when it happened, and I think it was in April. I was just a little kid at that time.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>I still remember my first day of school very clearly. The name of my school is \"Child Academy\". When my mom dropped me off, my teacher walked me to my classroom. I was feeling nervous, but my teacher was really kind to me. She quickly found me a seat at the front of the class, and a few students came up and shook my hand right away. That made me feel less scared. I found a math textbook and started doing some calculations after a few minutes of searching.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>After the lesson, a few more students came up to me and introduced themselves. It was exciting to make new friends at school. The school day ended at 1 p.m., and my dad picked me up and drove me back home.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

"reward": "<p><b>Summary of the Poem</b></p><h3>Major Symbols Used in the poem</h3> <p>Day = Life</p> <p>Sunrise = Birth</p> <p>Sunset = Death</p> <div> <div> <div></div> <p>In the poem \"A Day\", Emily Dickinson describes a beautiful day and how it moves from morning to night. She uses symbols to tell the story.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the morning, the sun rises. This symbolizes birth. When the sun comes up, its light hits the church tower and hills. Birds like the bobolink start singing lovely songs. Everything seems happy in the morning sunlight.</p><p><br /></p><p>As the day goes on, the speaker sees little yellow boys and girls climbing up stairs as they play. In the evening, the sky starts to get dark shades of red and purple. This is when the sunset happens. Sunset symbolizes death.</p><p><br /></p><p>When night comes, a man called the \"dominie\" guides the children home. He closes the gate so no one can come in or go out. The speaker doesn't really understand how the sun sets. This shows that no one knows what happens after death.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Main Theme</p><p>The main theme is about the journey of life from birth to death. The rising sun represents being born and the setting sun represents dying. The poem shows how children grow up and take on more responsibility like adults during the day, just as we live our lives. Death and what comes after it are also important themes.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Literary Devices</b></p><p>The poem uses symbols, metaphors, similes and personification. For example:</p><p>The poem uses these symbols: Day = Life, Sunrise = Birth, Sunset = Death</p><p>The sun's rays are described as \"ribbons\" (metaphor).</p><p>Hills are said to remove their \"bonnets\" in the morning (personification).</p><p>News of the sunrise spreads like squirrels running (simile).</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Stanza Breakdown</b></p><p>The poem is split into 4 short stanzas or parts. Each part describes a different time of the day from sunrise to night. The rising sun brings beauty and joy to nature. As the day ends, the children go home with the \"dominie\" and the mysteries of death are shown.</p><p>In the end, the poem beautifully depicts the cycle of life through the rising and setting of the sun each day. It shows both the wonders and unknowns of our lives on earth.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>The main topics in the poem are:</b></p><p>The cycle of life - The sunrise shows the start of a new day and sunset means the end, like how we are born and die.</p><p>Changing with time - As time passes, like the little kids climbing higher, we all grow and change as we get older.</p><p>Beauty in nature - Dickinson describes the natural sights beautifully, from the colors in the sky to the singing birds. Nature is amazing to look at.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br /></p> "

When does the speaker pray to the Lord?</strong></p> <p>The speaker prays to the Lord in the morning and evening.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. What does the speaker pray for?</strong></p> <p>The speaker prays for grace, sympathy and protection from God for the people of Milk Wood.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Who are the ‘poor creatures’? Why does the speaker call them ‘poor creatures’?</strong></p> <p>The 'poor creatures' refers to the residents of Milk Wood. The speaker calls them 'poor creatures' because they are made of flesh and bones and will die one day.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. What does Milk Wood sound like? A type of wood or a place? Why?</strong></p> <p>Milk Wood sounds like a place name because there is no article (a/an) used before it. Place names are usually not preceded by articles.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. Why do the inhabitants of Milk Wood bow to the setting sun ‘but just for now’?</strong></p> <p>The residents of Milk Wood bow to the setting sun as a way of temporary goodbye, as they expect the sun will rise again tomorrow. They believe God's grace and sun's warmth will help them survive another day.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference to the context</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Discuss “Every Morning When I Wake” as a prayer to God.</strong></p> <p><strong>=&nbsp;</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>\"Every Morning When I Wake\" is a prayer poem. In it, the speaker pleads to God for blessings and protection for all humans and animals. He prays that God may keep his loving eyes on all creatures who are destined to die.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Why does the speaker make a prayer to God, but not to a king, a billionaire or a scientist?</strong></p> <p><span>=&nbsp;</span>The speaker prays only to God because God is the supreme and ultimate being. He is the creator and savior of all. Kings, billionaires and scientists derive their power, wealth and knowledge from God-created world. But they are not eternal like God. Only God can provide true protection and guide humans throughout their lives.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. How does the poet highlight the magnificence of God?</strong></p> <p><span>=</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>The poet highlights God's magnificence by pointing out that</span> God's presence is holy. He created and saved humankind. People revere and depend on Him. And He guides humans throughout their lives until death and in afterlife. This highlights God's greatness.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. How does the rhyme scheme of the poem reinforce its message?</strong></p> <p><span>=</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The AABB rhyme scheme gives the poem a rhythmic flow like a prayer or song. This makes the appeal to God more sincere, soothing and engaging. The repeated end rhymes reinforce the poem's theme of pleading to God.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference beyond the text</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Does God exist? Give your opinion.</strong></p> <p><span>=&nbsp;</span>As a Hindu who believes in God, I am firmly convinced of God's existence.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Hindu scriptures like the Vedas and Upanishads that I consider sacred texts provide profound insights about the nature of divine reality. They speak of Brahman - the supreme, eternal unchanging spirit as the ultimate truth.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>I find the concept of Brahman permeating and sustaining this entire universe in forms like Vishnu, Shiva etc to be very logical. For me, design and precise workings of nature reflect an intelligent creative force behind it.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>I believe God is the sublime answer to the deepest mysteries of life, consciousness and existence.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Personal experiences with prayer and meditation have also reaffirmed my faith by connecting me to a higher power. Spiritual practices have brought transformation that I think comes from interacting with the divine.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>With the Gita and teachings of saints as my guidance, belief in God helps me live righteously and find meaning. So based on my religion, experiences and truths I have discovered, I have no hesitation in firmly upholding the reality of God.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. In his Epistle to the author of the book, The Three Impostors (1768), Voltaire says, “Even if God didn’t exist, it would be necessary to invent him.” Write an essay highlighting the importance of God in the society.</strong></p> <p><span>=&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Title: The Significance of God in Society: Voltaire's Perspective</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Introduction:</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Voltaire's statement, 'Even if God didn't exist, it would be necessary to invent him,' highlights the profound importance of God in society. This essay explores the various ways in which the concept of God is significant for society, including moral guidance, social cohesion, existential meaning, and as a coping mechanism.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Moral Guidance:</span></p> <p><span>Belief in God provides a moral framework.

"reward": "<p><b>Summary</b></p><p><br /></p><p>This poem is a simple prayer or blessing that is said each morning and evening in the Milk Wood town. This poem has been written by Dylan Thomas.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the morning, the speaker makes a little prayer asking God to keep His loving eye on all the poor creatures who were born to die. They ask God to watch over and protect the inhabitants of the town. It shows that the speaker cares about all living things and knows that life is fragile and doesn't last forever.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the evening at sundown, the speaker asks for a blessing on the whole town. They acknowledge the uncertainty of life, suggesting that whether people will make it through the night is uncertain (\"touch-and-go\"). This stanza highlights the speaker's awareness of the unpredictability of life and their desire for divine protection and guidance.</p><p><br /></p><p>The third stanza recognizes that the people of the town are neither wholly bad nor good, but live imperfect lives under Milk Wood. They have faith that God will see their best nature, not their worst. This stanza dives into the complexities of human nature. The speaker expresses faith that God sees the best in people rather than focusing on their flaws or imperfections.</p><p><br /></p><p>Finally, the prayer asks to see another day and for God to bless them all that night. It expresses the hope that they will all bow to the sun in the morning, saying goodbye to the day now ending, but with the expectation of another sunrise to see. The poem ends with a temporary farewell (\"good-bye – but just for now\"), suggesting that they will return to their daily routine, including their prayers, the next morning.</p><p><br /></p><p>The poem shows humility, faith and a strong bond with God and nature. It shows the importance of caring for others, admitting our flaws, and wanting the best for our community. The daily prayers remind us that life is fragile and we need God's help and support, especially during hard times.</p><p><br /></p><p>The tone of the poem is kind and thoughtful. It encourages us to stop and think about the meaning of daily routines, the beauty around us in nature, and how faith can guide us through life's difficulties.</p><p><br /></p> "

      "story": "<p><span>I Was My Own Route by Julia De Burgos</span></p> <p><br /></p><p>Written by Shriram Lamichhane | © The SR Zone</p> <p><br /></p><p><strong>ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Why did the speaker try to be the way men wanted her to be?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>The speaker tried to be the way men wanted her to be because</span> she wanted to meet the standards and norms that society had for her roles, behavior and appearance.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. What do you understand by her feet 'would not accept walking backwards'?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>When it says 'Her feet would not accept walking backwards', it means she did not want to follow men or go according to what men said. She wanted women to be equal to men and have the same opportunities in life, not be treated as less important than men.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Who are the old guards? Why did they grow desperate?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The old guards were the conservative people at that time who strongly supported the belief that men should have more power than women. Julia was gradually getting free from society's patriarchal rules and was aware of her rights, which made the old guards worried.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. How did the speaker have ‘a feeling of intimate liberation'?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The speaker had a feeling of intimate liberation because she stopped following the rules made by men and started living according to her own choices.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. Why did the desire to follow men warp in her?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>At first, the speaker tried to be what society and men expected of her. But as she went on her journey and embraced her true identity and freedom, she realized she no longer wanted to conform to those expectations. This shift in her desires, from conformity to personal liberation, is what is meant by her desire \"warping\" within her. It signifies that her initial inclination to follow societal norms and men's expectations changed into a desire for personal freedom and self-expression.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference to the text&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>a. What does the speaker mean when she says she was playing a game of hide and seek with her being'?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>When the speaker says she was playing a game of hide and seek with herself, she means she didn't really know who she was. The rules of the society at that time made it hard for her to express herself freely and discover her true identity.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Why, in your view, was her back ripped by the old guards as she was advancing forward?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The old guards ripped her back because they wanted to stop her from progressing further and getting more rights. Since the old guards strongly believed in the old rules of the society which didn't give many freedom to women.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>C. What, according to the speaker, did it feel like to be free?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>According to the speaker, being free felt like a bird flying in the sky without any restrictions of the society or gender roles. It meant she could choose her own path and do what she wanted.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Why does the speaker prefer the present to the past?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The speaker prefers present over past because in the past she faced many difficulties due to the rules of the male-dominated society which didn't allow her to take decisions and express herself freely. But now she is free from all those limitations and able to live on her own terms.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. John Donne, in his poem “No Man is an Island'', says, “No man is an island entire of itself.” Would Burgos agree with Donne? Do you agree with Donne or Burgos?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>When John Donne wrote that \"No man is an island entire of itself\", he meant that people depend on each other in society and we all influence each other. I think Burgos may not fully agree with Donne because she was fighting for women's equal rights and independence in a male-dominated society.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>However, I agree more with John Donne's view. While it is important for women to have equal rights and opportunities, cutting off all connections from society or dependence on others is not realistic or ideal. Both men and women play important roles and we function better as interconnected parts of a whole society rather than as totally isolated individuals. Society progresses in a balanced way when both genders support each other as equal partners. So overall, Donne's idea of interdependence seems like a more practical philosophy to me.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>REFERENCE BEYOND THE TEXT&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Write an essay on My Idea of Freedom.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>My Idea of Freedom : an essay&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Freedom is the ability to act and behave without being stopped. It means being able to do what you want without others getting in the way. It also means having the mindset that you can do whatever you want, whenever you want.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Different people have different ideas about what freedom means. For me, it means having the power to make my own choices. It's a basic right that every person should have from the moment they are born. Even though freedom can't be seen or touched, it's something that should always exist.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Freedom can be used in different ways, and it's not the same for everyone. In my view, freedom is about being able to live the life you want, go where you want, eat what you want, and learn what you want, as long as you have the means to do so. There are many definitions of freedom, like political, social, personal, and religious freedom. But the need for freedom is something that everyone shares, no matter what the situation is.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Not all people, however, seem to agree with the kind of freedom upheld by Burgos in this poem. For example, William Faulkner, in his novel Requiem for a Nun, says, “The past is never dead. It's not even past. All of us labor in webs spun long before we were born, webs of heredity and environment, of desire and consequence, of history and eternity.\" Do you agree with Faulkner? Why? Why not?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Whether or not one agrees with William Faulkner's statement that \"The past is never dead. It's not even past\" depends on their perspective and beliefs. I agree on his views.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Faulkner's view suggests that the past continues to influence and shape our lives, even if we are not directly aware of it. He emphasizes the interconnectedness of our personal histories, family backgrounds, societal influences, and the consequences of past actions. According to this perspective, our past is like an invisible web that continues to affect our present and future.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>I agree with Faulkner because people can see evidence of how their own past experiences, family upbringing, cultural heritage, and historical context have a lasting impact on their lives. These factors shape their values, behaviors, and choices in ways that are not easily escaped.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Others may disagree with Faulkner's statement, believing that individuals have the capacity to break free from the constraints of the past and make independent choices. They may argue that personal growth, self-awareness, and conscious decision-making can allow individuals to overcome the influence of their past and create a different future.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ultimately, whether one agrees with Faulkner or not depends on their perspective on the extent to which the past shapes human existence and the degree of agency individuals have in shaping their own destinies.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

"reward": "      <p><b>Summary&nbsp;</b></p><p>This poem appears to be about a woman breaking free from societal expectations of how she should be and living her life authentically on her own terms. The poem talks about trying to be what others want instead of our true self. The speaker compares this to hiding from who they really are. They realize they are unique and can't go back to how things used to be.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the first lines, she says she wanted to be how \"men wanted me to be\" - conforming to their ideas of what a woman's life should look like. But she realized she was \"made of nows\" - living in the present moment, not able to go backwards.</p><p><br /></p><p>When she walked forward on her own path, going against the \"old guard\" or traditional ways of thinking, her back was \"ripped\" by their disapproving flapping wings. The speaker decides to accept who they are and keep moving forward on their own path. This causes problems with the \"old guard\" who want things to stay the same. As she continued forward, she separated more from familiar horizons/ways of seeing the world.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Her face/expression took on a feeling of \"intimate liberation\" - freedom to truly be herself. By following the own way, the speaker feels free instead of being held back by the past and traditions. In the end, she found her real identity and reason for living now, without listening to what others expect. She felt like a blossom belonging to all the soils/places, without constraints of history, future or man-made boundaries.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the end, she lived her life as \"life in me\" - authentically from within, not conforming to outside expectations anymore. The main message is about accepting yourself and not worrying about conforming to society or history. The speaker finds power in being their authentic self today instead of hiding it.</p><p><br /></p><p>So in summary, it's about a woman breaking free from prescribed gender roles and societal constraints to live openly and authentically according to her own truth.</p> <p><br /></p> "

Why, in your view, have these people ‘lived with poverty's rage'?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The people have 'lived with poverty's rage' because they have experienced the hardships and struggles associated with poverty, which lead to frustration, anger, and a desire for a better life.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Why does the poet appeal for solidarity among the people?</strong></p> <p>The poet appeals for solidarity among the people because they are interconnected and can achieve more by working together. Unity and cooperation can lead to positive changes and improvements in their lives. The sole reason for the poet's appeal for solidarity is to bring equality, freedom and sentiments of fraternity, justice, togetherness and harmony among people.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Does the poet present migration in a positive light? Why? Why not?</strong></p> <p>The poet presents migration in a positive light because it can lead to new experiences, perspectives, and connections, which the poet views as valuable. According to the poet, the migrants' new ideas and creativity help awaken people from pain and suffering.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. Nepal is also known for its economic as well as educational migrants. Have you noticed any change in the perceptions and behaviours of these migrants when they return home from abroad?</strong></p> <p>Yes, Nepali economic and educational migrants change when they return from foreign countries. They bring back money and new knowledge. For example, people like eye surgeon Sanduk Ruit changed people's behaviors and businesses after returning from India with his specialty.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. Relate the rhyme scheme of this sonnet to the kind of life idealised by the poet.</strong></p> <p>The rhyme scheme of this sonnet, which is AA BB CC DD EE FF GG, reflects the idea of interconnectedness and unity among people. Just as each line in the sonnet rhymes with another, people are connected and linked together in hope and solidarity, as emphasized by the poet. The rhyme scheme reinforces the message of the poem about the importance of working together for a brighter future.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>REFERENCE BEYOND THE TEXT</strong></p> <p><strong>Write an essay on 'The Impacts of Migration on Nepali Society :</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Immigration in Nepali Society</strong></p> <p>In Nepal, there are ongoing debates among scientists and policymakers regarding the effects of emigration on the country's economy. More and more people are moving to the Terai and plain areas in order to improve their lives or protect their livelihoods.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>There are various reasons why people choose to leave their homes, such as seeking education, pursuing better opportunities, escaping poverty, or fleeing from tragic circumstances. The migration of people from the central hills of Nepal has different impacts on the people who stay behind, their livelihoods, and the way land is managed.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Migration can have positive effects on people's lives. It can enhance their quality of life by exposing them to new cultures, traditions, and languages, which in turn promotes a stronger sense of community. The emigration of highly skilled workers also contributes to economic development in the region.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>However, there are also negative consequences of population growth resulting from migration. It puts strains on existing social institutions, increases the demand for goods and services, displaces local residents from rural and urban occupations, leads to a decline in sanitation, and contributes to increased pollution in urban areas due to the influx of migrants. Other challenges include a greater reliance on remittances, inefficient use of natural resources like farmland, and wasteful spending.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In summary, the impact of emigration in Nepal is a subject of scientific and policy debate. While migration can bring positive changes to people's lives and contribute to economic growth, it also presents challenges such as strains on social institutions, increased demand for resources, and environmental issues.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

      "story": "<p><span>Soft Storm Poem by Abhi Subedi</span></p> <p><br /></p><p>Written by Shriram Lamichhane | © The SR Zone</p><p><br /></p> <p><strong>Meaning&nbsp;</strong><span>: Soft Storm: Non-Violent Revolt&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Answer the following questions.</strong></p> <p><strong>a. When does the speaker grow soft? Enlist the occasions when he grows soft.</strong></p> <p><span>The speaker softens as he hears uproar, the sky blooms like crocuses, the moon skids, hungry children cry, a alone kid looks for his mother, a man is mercilessly beaten, etc.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. What do you understand by 'this seamless city'?</strong></p> <p>The term \"this seamless city\" refers to a city where everything is connected and tangled together, like a big mess of problems, challenges, and chaos. In this city, there are no clear boundaries or divisions separating different issues. It's as if all the difficulties and complexities of urban life are twisted together, making it hard to tell one problem apart from another. This lack of separation creates a feeling of confusion and disorder throughout the city.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Describe the poor children portrayed in the poem.</strong></p> <p>The poor children in the poem are depicted as being very hungry and suffering from poverty. They are pictured crying from hunger under some trees. These children represent the difficulties faced by marginalized and underprivileged childrens.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. What do you understand about the unwedded gardens of history'?</strong></p> <p>The \"unwedded gardens of history\" symbolize a time where there is no order or justice in society due to dominance and imbalance of power. It refers to a period where social values and norms were not well established or followed.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. Why was the forlorn child wailing?</strong></p> <p>The forlorn child was crying loudly because he was trying to find his mother but could not in the middle of past violence and confusion. He was crying from fear and desperation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. What do you understand about 'soft storm'?</strong></p> <p>\"Soft storm\" represents a non-violent revolt or desire for change in society. It shows the speaker's desire for transformation of problems, but in a non-violent way.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. Why does the speaker call our time 'mad time'?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The speaker calls our time \"mad time\" because it is characterized by chaos, violence and social issues. People are more self-centered and moral values seem to be lost. It is a time of societal confusion and disorder.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. What does the speaker want to do during his \"Hard times\"?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>In \"hard times,\" the speaker wants to melt like a rainbow. This suggests that in the face of challenging and difficult circumstances, the speaker desires to maintain a sense of hope, positivity, and unity. The melting of the soft storm into a rainbow symbolizes a desire for positive change and transformation even during difficult times.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference to the context</strong></p> <p><strong>a. The poet uses the word 'soft' with the words like 'storm' and 'gale', which generally refer to disorder and violence. What effect does the poet achieve through the use of such anomalous expressions?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The poet achieves an effect of contrast and irony by using the word 'soft' with 'storm' and 'gale,' which typically imply disorder and violence. This contrast highlights the poet's non-violent approach to addressing societal issues, emphasizing the idea of a peaceful revolution or revolt.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. How does the speaker feel about the historical period he describes?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The speaker's attitude towards the time described in the poem is critical and disapproving. He views the current time as chaotic, filled with social issues and problems that disturb him.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. What is the speaker like? A rebel? Why? Why not?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The speaker can be seen as a rebel in a non-violent sense. While he doesn't resort to violence, his strong disapproval of the societal issues and his desire for change indicate a rebellious spirit against the prevailing norms and injustices. He seeks to challenge the existing order through his words and emotions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. Explain the following stanza:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong><em>I became soft</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>when I saw</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>a blood-stained shirt</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>speaking in the earth’s ears</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>with bruised human lips</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>in the far corner</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>under the moon</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>of history and dreams</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>playing hide and seek</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>in open museums</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>of human times.</em></strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>In this stanza, the speaker becomes \"soft\" when they witness a blood-stained shirt with bruised human lips. This imagery symbolizes violence and suffering. The mention of the \"moon of history and dreams\" suggests that this suffering is hidden in the depths of human history and often overlooked, like a forgotten museum exhibit. It portrays the speaker's empathy and sensitivity to the pain of others.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference beyond the text</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Write an essay, highlighting your dissatisfaction towards social, cultural, economic and political issues prevailing in Nepal at present.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span>Nepal's Social, Cultural, Economic, and Political Issues</span></p> <p>There are several issues in Nepal that I find concerning. These include gender inequality, discrimination against women, the trafficking of girls, and violence against women. I am dissatisfied with the current multiparty democratic system, which I believe lacks adherence to the rule of law and human rights. The constitutional rights of the people are often disregarded by those in power, who engage in dirty politics.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Nepotism and favoritism are widespread problems in the country, permeating the entire system. Despite predictions of decreasing poverty by the United Nations, a significant portion of Nepal's population still lives below the poverty line. There are also disparities in values and customs, leading to social and cultural inequalities.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Due to economic and social conditions, as well as limited access to education, a significant portion of the population in Nepal is unable to participate in public events and achieve social and cultural equality. This is often accompanied by social stigma and shame.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>I strongly disagree with the social system in the country, particularly with regard to the treatment of Dalits, who are the most marginalized group within the caste system. They face economic limitations and restrictions based on their status.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Assume you're a rebel seeking to transform society by eradicating social injustices and inconsistencies. A speech articulating your vision for change should be written.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ladies, gentlemen, and dear friends,</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Greetings! I am Shriram Lamichhane, and today I want to address the numerous social problems that are hindering our country's progress.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Even in our modern society, we still face widespread issues like drunkenness, racism, and child abuse. Nepal is grappling with socioeconomic problems such as the caste system, child labor, underage marriage, illiteracy, and gender inequality.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>One of the major challenges is illiteracy. It is our duty as educated individuals to raise awareness and promote education among the less privileged population.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Another concern is child labor and child marriage. Without education, a child is like a bird without wings. In today's world, lack of education can lead to many difficulties. Let's encourage our children to study before entering the workforce.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Our ancestors established social classes based on occupations thousands of years ago. The Sudras, the lowest caste, were the most oppressed. They were even barred from entering temples.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The issue of poverty needs immediate attention. Illiteracy, caste discrimination, and unemployment are the three main factors contributing to poverty. The government should provide training for the unemployed.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Poor hygiene conditions are another societal problem. Each citizen has a responsibility to keep our nation clean.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Gender inequality is also an issue we must address. Both men and women suffer from the narrow-mindedness of society.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>To tackle these social ills, we need an integrated approach. Education with strong moral and ethical values is key. The government should take more effective actions and work towards eliminating these problems from public discourse.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In conclusion, there is much work to be done to eradicate these social ills from our society. We must educate the public and work together to address these challenges.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Thank you all for your efforts in creating a better society. Best wishes to everyone in our collective journey towards a brighter future.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Thank you!</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

"reward": "      <p><strong>Summary</strong></p> <p>This poem shows how the person speaking goes from just watching problems in society to wanting to make good changes without using violence&nbsp;&nbsp;in a peaceful way. At first, the person just sees what is wrong. But by the end, they want to be like a \"soft storm\" and fix things in a nice way. The poet offers quiet criticism of problems in Nepali culture.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the first part, the poet uses vivid pictures to show the confusion and mess happening in society. Natural things are compared to how people act with words like \"loud noise\", \"scary\", \"quiet\", \"flowers in the sky\", \"rocks\", \"slipping moon\", and \"tearing ceiling\". The last line hints that the city used to be more united and have less issues, like a nice memory.</p><p><br /></p><p>The second part talks about poor children crying for food in Thamel, showing the tough realities a growing country faces. \"Unwedded gardens of history\" refers to past times of no rules, mess, and people misusing power.</p><p><br /></p><p>The third part is sad because it talks about homeless kids and people hurting each other. It shows how some people make society and nature worse by doing bad things selfishly or illegally. This illustrates the speaker's rebellion against the system due to these upsetting experiences.</p><p><br /></p><p>Later parts portray harm done to society and nature with deforestation, strange events like flowers in January, and sad bird sounds. These symbolize loss of values and environment damage from human thoughtlessness, greed, and criminal actions.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the end, the speaker wants freedom for themselves and all creatures on Earth, envisioning a peaceful world shown as a calm sky and soothing storm sound. The speaker dreams of a peaceful world where everything is calm, like a soothing storm.</p><p><br /></p><p>The term \"soft storm\" means a gentle revolution or peaceful protest against the current problems. It shows the speaker's commitment to creating good changes in a non-violent way during a turbulent time. The whole poem asks us to care about each other and fix society's mistakes nicely instead of with violence. By becoming a \"soft storm\", the person wants to help make the world better for everyone.</p> <p><br /></p> "

He preferred studying things out of genuine personal interest rather than just following instructions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d.

Why was he so biassed about sciences, especially astronomy and chemistry?</strong></p> <p>Since childhood the author was curious to learn about science. To gain a deeper understanding, he focused his research on specific topics like astronomy and chemistry within the science field.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. Why did he become so fascinated by Hook?</strong></p> <p>The author was fascinated by Hook due to his satire and operas. As a theatre personality of that era, Hook was admired for his humor and musical skills.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. Describe the library at the Queen’s College.</strong></p> <p>The Queen's College Library is an historic and beautifully designed building in Oxford. The 17th century Upper Library is available to students and offers a pleasant environment for reading after recent renovation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. Why did the students ignore the bookshelves in the 1990s?</strong></p> <p>In the 1990s, students had access to electronic versions of books via devices like computers. So they didn't need to refer physical books on the shelves as much.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>i. Why was he horrified when he visited the library a couple of months ago?</strong></p> <p>He was shocked to find most of the books had been discarded in recent years, erasing centuries of collected knowledge, which felt like a great loss to him.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference to the context&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>a. The author says, “I was not a good pupil, but I was a good listener.” Justify it with the textual evidence.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>In the article, Oliver Sacks says 'I wasn't a good student, but I was an excellent learner.' He enjoyed exploring different genres of books on his own terms rather than just focusing on classroom learning and homework. He preferred learning from books of his own interest in libraries rather than strictly following a teacher's instructions in school. So while he may not have always complied with school requirements, he was highly interested in gathering knowledge by listening through reading diverse texts.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. A proverb says, \"Nothing is pleasanter than exploring a library.\" Does this proverb apply in the essay? Explain.</strong></p> <p>Yes, the proverb applies to the essay. Oliver Sacks enjoyed spending time in libraries due to the peaceful environment and opportunity to explore a wide range of topics on his own. He cherished the meditative atmosphere and company of other readers. Libraries offered pleasure through his love of reading books. The essay highlights how reading in libraries was a passion for Oliver Sacks and brought him joy, as suggested in the proverb.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Are there any other services that you would like to see added to the library?</strong></p> <p>Some services that can be added to modernize libraries include facilities like tabs for digital reading, WiFi for internet access, Braille services for visually impaired, small cafes for students, and audio-visual sections with DVDs/videos to complement books. These additions can help make libraries more accessible and support different learning styles in the current technology-oriented times.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference beyond the text&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Write an essay on Libraries and its uses for students.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Libraries and Their Uses for Students</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Libraries are invaluable resources for students, offering numerous benefits that enhance their educational experience. These institutions provide access to a wide range of books, both fiction and non-fiction, allowing students to explore various subjects and expand their knowledge. Libraries serve as quiet study spaces, fostering an atmosphere conducive to focused learning and concentration. They provide an escape from distractions, enabling students to immerse themselves in their studies and achieve academic success.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Moreover, libraries play a crucial role in promoting information literacy. Librarians are skilled professionals who can assist students in locating relevant resources, teaching them how to evaluate the credibility of sources and develop effective research skills. Students can learn to navigate the vast amount of information available and become critical thinkers.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Libraries have adapted to the digital age, offering access to online databases, e-books, and other digital resources. This allows students to access information anytime, anywhere, and bridges the digital divide. Many libraries also provide computer and internet access, ensuring equal opportunities for all students.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Additionally, libraries serve as community spaces, hosting events, workshops, and author talks. Students can engage in book clubs and literary festivals, fostering a sense of camaraderie and intellectual growth.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In conclusion, libraries are vital for students as they provide access to knowledge, facilitate focused study, promote information literacy, and create a sense of community. Students should take full advantage of these resources, as libraries are not just buildings filled with books, but gateways to academic achievement and lifelong learning.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Do you have any public libraries in your locality? If so, do the people in your community use it? Give a couple of examples.</strong></p> <p>Yes, we have a public library in our society, and it is an important part of our community. Libraries have played a crucial role in the development of our civilized society, and they will continue to do so as we expand our knowledge and learning capacities. Learning and libraries go hand in hand in our community.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Libraries are particularly important because not everyone has access to the technology we use today. In our library, we organize reading sessions for students and the community, along with book sales and library groups. These activities help shape our society and make it more educated. The library is a place where you can find information on topics you're interested in or need to learn about. It's also a place where you can relax and have fun, and possibly even make new friends.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For many local people, the library is essential because they rely on the computers available there to complete tasks such as paying bills, sending emails, doing schoolwork, or studying. While some people have these resources at home, not everyone does.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Technology can sometimes fail due to power outages or worn-out components, but libraries remain open and reliable. They serve as physical repositories of information and knowledge in our society, ensuring that important resources are preserved. Libraries play a vital role in safeguarding information through manuscripts and serving as a backup in case of data loss during transportation. That's why libraries are inseparable from our community.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

"reward": "<p><strong>Summary</strong></p> <p>Oliver Sacks loved books and libraries his whole life. As a child, he spent a lot of time in the big library at his home. It had his father's books on Hebrew studies and plays by Ibsen. It also had books from his 3 older brothers. There he found The Jungle Book and felt like the boy Mowgli.</p><p><br /></p><p>His mother kept books by authors like Dickinson, Trollope, Shaw, and Kipling in the living room. Medical books were locked in a closet. Sacks would get so into reading that he lost track of time. Whenever, he got late for food or meal, he could be found in the library reading the books.</p><p><br /></p><p>The most important library was the local public library in Willesden. As a child, Sacks spent hours there. He feels he learned more there than in school. In the library, he could freely explore any topic that interested him.</p><p><br /></p><p>At school and college, Sacks also found great libraries too. At St. Paul's School and Oxford University, he followed interests in science, especially chemistry. At Oxford he learned a lot about Theodore Hook by researching him.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sacks' favorite Oxford library was at Queen's College. There he found old books and first editions by authors like Darwin, Browne, Swift, Johnson, Hume, Pope and Dryden. This introduced him to 17th-18th century literature and gave him a sense of history.</p><p><br /></p><p>In 1965 in New York, Sacks used the big library at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He saw it as a community place. But by the 1990s, students accessed books more through computers than physically.</p><p><br /></p><p>The college then got rid of most of its book collection over some years. This shocked and upset Sacks. He was sad about losing the special feeling of books and knowledge in the library.</p><p><br /></p><p>In conclusion, Sacks' essay looks back nostalgically on his deep personal and learning connections to libraries. It also shows his sadness as physical books are replaced by electronic books from the digital age.</p> <p><br /></p> "

      "story": "<p><span>Marriage as a Social Institution&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p><p>Written by Shriram Lamichhane | © The SR Zone</p><p><strong>Understanding the Text</strong></p> <p><strong>Answer the following Questions.</strong></p> <p><strong>a. According to the author, what is marriage?</strong></p> <p><span>Marriage is the union of two people who are legally, morally, and culturally linked together and have a wide range of close personal relationships.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. How is marriage an institution?</strong></p> <p>Marriage is a social institution because:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Society defines rules around marriage like who can marry whom.</p> <p>It promotes social values like responsible procreation and family units.</p> <p>Families are basic building blocks of communities and societies.</p> <p>Marriage assigns roles within families that impact power structures.</p> <p>Cultural traditions around marriage bring people together.</p> <p>It determines legal aspects like inheritance, adoption through social norms.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>So in short, as a socially recognized and regulated relationship, marriage plays an important part in population, community, law and traditions - making it a core social institution.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. What are the rules that a marriage has?</strong></p> <p>The rules of marriage traditionally involve voluntary participation from mature, heterosexual adults. It is expected that husbands will take on the role of primary earners, both partners will remain sexually faithful to each other, and married couples may choose to become parents. These rules form the central foundation of marriage in American society.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Why does marriage matter to men?</strong></p> <p>Marriage matters for men because it gives structure to their lives. It helps them organize what they want to do and stops them from doing things on impulse. Marriage offers a way to control desires and decide what is right.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. What is one of the central problems in modern society?</strong></p> <p>The author says a big problem in modern society is not having limits on wants for things like comfort, luxury and status. These wants can keep growing. Marriage and other social institutions help control these wants.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. What does a social capital consist of?</strong></p> <p>Social capital means the networks of people connected through trust. These connections need mutual support. Marriage creates new ties with spouse's relatives and friends. This builds long-term networks of support.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. What is normative marriage?</strong></p> <p><span>Normative marriage is the marriage which follows social norms and values. The six characteristics of normative marriage in the United States are, marriages are joined freely by mature, heterosexual individuals; husbands are the primary earners; partners are sexually faithful; and parents are involved.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference to the Context</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Discuss the six dimensions that define normative marriage in America.</strong></p> <p>The six dimensions of normative marriage in America are as follow:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>People choose to get married willingly as mature adults of the opposite sex.</p> <p>Traditionally, men are expected to be the main earners and financially support the family.</p> <p>Spouses should only have each other as sexual partners and not be with anyone else.</p> <p>Married couples are usually expected to have children and take care of them as parents.</p> <p>Marriage helps control behavior and set rules on what is allowed in the relationship.</p> <p>Normative marriage follows the general rules and values of society related to marriage and family.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In summary, these six points define what is considered a normal and traditional marriage in American culture based on common expectations, roles and social influences.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Do marriages differ according to culture? How is your marriage practice different from marriage in America?</strong></p> <p><span>Ans: -&nbsp;</span>I am Hindu. In Hinduism, marriage is an important occasion for joining a man and woman as husband and wife. It also unites the two families spiritually and culturally.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Most people in Nepal follow Hindu traditions for marriage. The rituals are different in different parts of the country and even within the country.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Marriage customs vary based on location. What people do in one place is different from others.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Since I am Hindu and the US follows Christianity, our marriage ceremonies are conducted differently.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In the US, vows are said in front of God in a church to show love and commitment. Friends and family are asked if they approve the marriage. Rings are exchanged as a symbol of love. The first kiss makes them officially husband and wife.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In Hinduism, marriages usually happen at home or in a temple. Vows are said in front of sacred fire or priests to request the blessing of Gods. Families get united through rituals and ceremonies as per our customs and traditions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference beyond the text&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Write an essay on the marriage practice in your own culture.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Marriage in Hinduism</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In Hinduism, marriage takes different forms - monogamy allows one spouse, serial monogamy allows remarriage after death/divorce of first spouse, polygamy allows one husband with multiple wives or one wife with multiple husbands.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Marriage is evolving in our culture. It is no longer just for reproduction but also for emotional bonding and social obligations.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>During engagement, the bride and groom exchange rings and garlands with family blessings. Date of wedding is also fixed.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>On the wedding day, the groom arrives with music and procession followed by women bearing gifts. At bride's home, family priest performs wedding rituals in mandap.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Priest instructs rituals like pouring vermilion on bride's head and putting mangalsutra around her neck as they circle fire seven times. This signifies the marriage bond.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Wearing sindoor and mangalsutra shows the bride is married. Family and friends bless the new couple. Bride emotionally leaves her parents.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Groom's family warmly welcomes the newlyweds. The couple then starts their new married life together.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Is marriage a Social Institution? Discuss.</strong></p> <p>Marriage takes different forms in different cultures, but generally serves the purpose of bonding between individuals and integrating them into society.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In the past, practices like child marriage were common but are no longer accepted today. Widow remarriage and transgender marriage are now legally recognized in many places.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The definition of marriage varies based on traditional and modern views. Broadly, it refers to a legally binding lifelong union between two people who live together, have an emotional bond and possibly children.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Sociologists define marriage as a social institution that has been practiced since ancient times by all human groups and civilizations. It allows people to fulfill their personal and social needs.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Marriage provides a structured way for society to regulate relationships and offspring. It gives married couples legal rights and social status. Various rituals, customs and conventions make it an important part of social structure across cultures worldwide.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>So in essence, while forms may vary, marriage universally serves as a key institution to bond individuals and integrate them into communities through recognized rules and social practices.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

"reward": "<p><br /></p><p><b>Summary</b></p><p>The essay discusses marriage as a social institution that shapes relationships in significant ways. It argues that marriage is more than just the union of two people - it is a institution defined by established laws, morals and cultural standards.</p><p><br /></p><p>Marriage exists within and is connected to other social systems like education, economy and politics. It does not exist independently of these larger structures. The essay notes that marriage has boundaries and expectations that non-married relationships do not have. These rules influence how spouses act and arrange their lives.</p><p><br /></p><p>Married couples are part of a common set of principles that unmarried partners do not share. Marriage integrates individuals into an organized system with widely accepted meanings and roles.</p><p><br /></p><p>The essay then talks about Emile Durkheim's theory from over 100 years ago. According to Durkheim, marriage is good for men because it provides stability and structure. It helps men organize their goals and keep desires under control.</p><p><br /></p><p>Marriage assigns love a specific focus - the relationship between husband and wife. It also limits horizons by not allowing men to look for other types of satisfaction outside the marriage. Durkheim believed marriage channels impulses and ambitions in a useful way. It gives shape and purpose to male energies and prevents them from going in uncontrolled directions. This discipline helps husbands find happiness within marriage.</p><p><br /></p><p>It acknowledges some may find freedom and happiness in unmarried cohabitation by avoiding marriage rules/boundaries. However, cohabiting couples lack the established guidelines and expectations that marriage provides for navigating domestic life matters.</p><p><br /></p><p>Marriage also involves making promises and responsibilities to each other and to family members. These commitments are backed by laws and social norms. Spouses can define who they are and what they must do for each other because of their married status. Partners who aren't married don't have this.</p><p><br /></p><p>The essay then talks about how marriage makes \"social resources\" by creating family ties and trusting relationships through in-laws. These networks provide helpful support and important information over the years.</p><p><br /></p><p>However, these social resources rely on the surrounding social structures and community bonds that give them purpose. The strength of marriage connections depends on the larger institutions and relationships in the surrounding area that provide context.</p><p><br /></p><p>The essay concludes by summarizing six main aspects that typically define normal American marriage:</p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>Adults choose to get married by their own choice</li><li>Different expected roles with men providing financially and women caring for home/family</li><li>Marriage involves a man and woman only</li><li>Spouses only have romantic relationships with each other</li><li>Marriage is usually followed by having children</li><li>These factors represent mainstream American cultural norms and standards for marriage</li></ul><p></p><p><br /></p><p>Although some marriages don't exactly follow all points, they still represent the typical ideals and guidlines that set marriage apart from other relationships in US law, religion and traditions.</p><p><br /></p> <p><strong>How is Marriage defined as a Social Institution in Essay?</strong></p> <p>Marriage has rules and structures. The relationship between husbands and wives follows certain patterns, but also allows flexibility. Marriage is different from other types of relationships because it has gently guiding boundaries. These boundaries define allowable behaviors for married couples.</p><p><br /></p><p>By existing as a institution, marriage guides behavior and organizes family life according to societal norms. It connects the personal lives of husbands and wives to the larger community through legal and cultural frameworks that define appropriate conduct.</p><p><br /></p><p>Being married means joining a big system with widely understood ideas. This system helps organize human life and keep marriages going. It separates married people from other kinds of partnerships. The structures and rules of marriage give shape and purpose to the connection between husband and wife. They understand their roles within the institution of marriage.</p><p><br /></p><p>This institution provides a framework that married couples can follow in their own unique ways. It gives stability and direction to their relationship. The soft boundaries allow room for individualism, while retaining the shared identity of being part of marriage overall.</p><p><br /></p> "

      "story": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Knowledge and Wisdom&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p><p>Written by Shriram Lamichhane | © The SR Zone</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Exercise</strong></p> <p><strong>a. What are the factors that contribute to wisdom?</strong></p> <p><span>In the essay \"Knowledge and Wisdom,\" Bertrand Russell discusses numerous factors that lead to wisdom. Among the characteristics that lead to wisdom, according to him, are:&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>(I) a sense of proportion,&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>(ii) comprehensiveness with wide emotion,&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>(iii) emancipation from personal biases and sensory experience,&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>(iv) impartiality</span></p> <p><span>(v) knowledge of human needs and understanding.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. What message does the writer try to convey with the examples of technicians?</strong></p> <p>The writer uses the example of technicians to illustrate how the pursuit of specialized knowledge can lead to a lack of wisdom. He suggests that individuals focused on specialized fields, such as scientific medicine, may become so absorbed in their work that they fail to consider the broader consequences of their discoveries. This specialization can lead to a lack of wisdom as individuals may not see the bigger picture beyond their specific field of expertise.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Which leaders does Russell say were able to mix knowledge and wisdom soundly?</strong></p> <p>The writer mentions Queen Elizabeth I in England, Henry IV in France, and Abraham Lincoln as leaders who were able to combine knowledge and wisdom effectively. These leaders lived in times of religious and political tensions but managed to remain free from the errors of their time, demonstrating wisdom in their actions and decisions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Why is wisdom needed not only in public ways but in private life equally?</strong></p> <p>Wisdom is needed not only in public ways but also in private life because it helps individuals make wise choices in their personal lives. It involves making informed decisions, choosing meaningful goals, and avoiding harmful prejudices and biases. Wisdom in private life contributes to personal well-being and the well-being of those around us.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. What, according to Russell, the true aim of education?</strong></p> <p>According to Russell, the true aim of education should be to teach wisdom. He believes that knowledge and morals should not be separated in education, and that even specialized knowledge should be supplemented with a wider survey of human activities to put it in its proper context. Education should aim to produce good citizens of the world, capable of understanding and making wise choices.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. Can wisdom be taught? If so, how?</strong></p> <p>Yes, Russell believes that wisdom can be taught. He thinks that teaching wisdom should focus more on intellectual aspects rather than just moral lessons. Wisdom can be taught by showing the harmful outcomes of hatred and narrow-mindedness. Additionally, providing knowledge that helps individuals understand the wider effects of their actions can also contribute to developing wisdom.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. Why does the world need more wisdom in the future?</strong></p> <p>In the future, the world will need more wisdom because as people become more knowledgeable and skilled, they can do more things, both good and bad. Without wisdom, this ability to do more can lead to harmful results. As the world becomes more connected and complicated, wisdom becomes extremely important for making smart choices and avoiding unintended negative consequences.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference to the Context</strong></p> <p><strong>Answer the following questions.</strong></p> <p><strong>a. According to Russell, “The Pursuit of Knowledge may become harmful unless it is combined with wisdom.” Justify this statement.</strong></p> <p>Russell argues that knowledge alone can be harmful if it is not accompanied by wisdom. He supports this claim by providing examples of how specialized knowledge, such as in medicine or atomic research, can have negative consequences without the guidance of wisdom.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For instance, he mentions that scientists focusing solely on advancing medical knowledge may unintentionally disrupt food supplies and lower living standards in other areas while reducing infant mortality rates. Similarly, the pursuit of knowledge about atomic composition, without wisdom, can lead to the creation of destructive weapons that can harm humanity.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In these examples, actions driven purely by knowledge and lacking wisdom can have significant and negative impacts on society and the world. According to Russell, wisdom involves having a sense of proportion, understanding the broader goals of human life, and freeing oneself from personal biases. It allows individuals to consider the consequences of their actions and make informed and ethical choices.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Therefore, Russell emphasizes the importance of combining knowledge with wisdom to ensure that the pursuit of knowledge contributes positively to human well-being and avoids unintended harm.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. What, according to Russell, is the essence of wisdom? And how can one acquire the very essence?</strong></p> <p>According to Russell, wisdom is about freeing ourselves from the constraints of the present moment and our personal biases. It involves rising above our immediate emotions and senses, and being able to impartially consider distant or abstract concepts. Wisdom requires understanding the broader and long-term effects of our actions and decisions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>To develop wisdom, Russell suggests the following steps:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Broaden your horizons: Expand your knowledge beyond your immediate interests. Engage with different perspectives, cultures, and ideas to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the world.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Practice impartiality: Make an effort to consider different viewpoints and avoid being rigidly attached to personal biases. Strive for a more open-minded and objective approach to issues.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Reflect and contemplate: Take time for self-reflection and introspection. Think about the potential consequences of your actions and decisions, both in the short and long term.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Seek knowledge: Knowledge forms the foundation of wisdom. Continuously seek learning and education, while also considering the ethical and moral implications of the knowledge you acquire.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Cultivate empathy: Develop empathy and try to understand the experiences and perspectives of others. This helps you make wiser decisions that take into account the well-being of all.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Apply wisdom: Act on your wisdom by making choices that align with ethical and thoughtful considerations. Use your wisdom to positively contribute to your own life and the wider community.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In summary, acquiring wisdom involves self-awareness, open-mindedness, empathy, and the ability to transcend immediate personal concerns to consider the greater good and the consequences of our actions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference Beyond the Text</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Answer the following questions.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>a. Why is wisdom necessary in education? Discuss.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Wisdom is important in education for a few key reasons. It allows students to see topics from varied perspectives rather than just their own views. As people mature, emotions recede and they can apply lessons impartially. Wisdom ensures knowledge is used to benefit humanity. With wisdom, one can care for even those with opposing ideas while staying objective. Education provides knowledge, but wisdom guides its application. Without wisdom, people risk misusing new information. As an educational goal, wisdom should be cultivated through real-world examples while imparting facts. This nourishes good character in addition to teaching subjects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. How can you become wise? Do you think what you are doing in college contributes to wisdom?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Wisdom develops through patience, reflection and experience over time. In college, exposure to diverse ideas, intellectual challenges, and self-awareness can aid wisdom's growth. Mistakes are learning opportunities if one reflects calmly on their causes and effects. Maintaining optimism amid life's difficulties also marks the wise. What truly matters is persistently striving to understand various perspectives, make considerate choices, and better the world however possible - even within the bounds of academic life. College potentially affords perspective-gaining discussions, role models of ethical thinking, and chances to help others - all nurturing wisdom if intentionally pursued.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

"reward": "      <p><strong>Summary</strong></p> <p>In this essay, Russell makes a distinction between knowledge and wisdom. Knowledge is the accumulation of facts and information through learning and study.</p><p>Wisdom is something more than just knowledge. It involves applying knowledge and using it to create value or make good judgments/decisions. Wisdom develops from experience over time, not just from memorizing information. It comes from reflecting on what we learn and gaining insights.</p><p><br /></p><p>The essay starts by saying wisdom means balance and thinking about all parts of a problem. But now, experts only focus on their area and ignore the bigger picture. Wisdom is needed to prevent unintended harm when applying the knowledge.</p><p><br /></p><p>Having knowledge of many facts does not necessarily mean one is wise. Wisdom requires understanding how to properly use knowledge and considering all relevant factors in a situation. Russell argues that true wisdom involves having both knowledge/intellect but also compassion and understanding human lives from different perspectives.</p><p><br /></p><p>He says education should aim to cultivate wisdom in students, not just imparting knowledge. Students need to learn how to apply their learning productively.&nbsp; Wisdom is needed in private life to choose goals you can achieve and overcome personal biases. It compares wasting your life chasing something impossible like a magic stone, to two people destroying each other through hatred caused by distorted views of each other.</p><p><br /></p><p>The key distinction Russell draws is that knowledge deals with acquiring information, while wisdom is the skillful use of knowledge to create benefit. It comes from experience, not just accumulation of data.</p><p><br /></p> <p><span>Overall, his definition of wisdom includes:</span></p> <p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>Having a broad perspective.</li><li>Being impartial.</li><li>Focusing on humanity, not just self.</li><li>Learning about various people/times and situations.</li><li>Expanding knowledge beyond immediate concerns.</li></ul><p></p> <p><br /></p><p>The essay concludes knowledge should include an element of wisdom by incidentally showing hatred's disastrous effects. Morals and knowledge should not be too separate. Even experts need common sense wisdom through a broad education to stop knowledge from being misused, and making wisdom ever more crucial as humanity's power grows.</p><p><br /></p> "

Describe the claim of the Chinese nationalists about human history.</strong></p> <p>Chinese nationalists believe that history began with early dynasties in China like the Yellow Emperor and Xia and Shang dynasties. They think that other cultures like West, Muslims, and Indians just copied ideas from China.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. What do pious Muslims believe about human history?</strong></p> <p>For pious Muslims, history before the prophet Muhammad is not very important. They believe that after the discovery of the Quran, history started with the rise of Islam and Muslim community.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. What did the Aztecs firmly believe about the universe?</strong></p> <p>The Aztecs had some beliefs about the universe. They thought that if they didn't make yearly sacrifices, the sun would stop rising and the whole universe would fall apart.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. What, according to the essay, are the universal human abilities?</strong></p> <p>According to the essay, universal human abilities are things like morality, creativity, religion, and inventiveness.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. How are the basic yoga postures derived from the shape of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet ?</strong></p> <p>Some basic yoga poses look like letters from the Hebrew alphabet. For example, the pose Trikonasanna looks like the letter \"aleph\" and Tuladandasana looks like the letter \"dalet\".</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference to the Context</strong></p> <p><strong>a. How do Hindu nationalists refute the Chinese claim that human history really began with the Yellow Emperor and the Xia and Shang dynasties? Who do you agree with, and why?</strong></p> <p><span>People who are Hindu nationalists say that planes and nuclear bombs were invented long before Confucius, Plato, Einstein, and the Wright brothers. They say that Indian sages did this long before Plato, Confucius, Einstein, and the Wright brothers.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Because Hinduism has been found to be one of the world's oldest religions through both scientific and archaeological research, I agree with the Indian nationalists over the Chinese.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. The author has dealt with a controversial debate on human history. Why do you think history has been a major contested issue in the present world?</strong></p> <p>History has become a debate today for a few key reasons. People are egoistic and everyone thinks their culture is the best. They believe their history started first. Also, the availability and quality of evidence plays an important role in these debates. If there is a lack of clear evidence or incomplete/conflicting evidence, it affects how events are understood. This can lead to more disagreements and controversies. The author wants us to see each other as equals instead of one group feeling more important than others. People being selfish as well as issues around evidence are why history is such a debated topic now.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference beyond the text</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Write a short essay on The Conflicting History of Human Civilization.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>&nbsp;The Conflicting History of Human Civilization</strong></p> <p>Humans have a tendency to feel superior and believe that their own culture or civilization is the most important. This ego-centric view has been observed throughout history, from ancient civilizations like Mesopotamia, Egypt, Maya, India, China, Rome, and Greece. Each culture tends to think of itself as the center of the universe.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For example, Hindus attribute the modern technology we have today to their own culture. Some believe that Chinese inventions surpass those of the West, Muslims, or Indians. Greeks often consider history to have begun in Athens, Sparta, Alexandria, or Constantinople, all cities in Greece. Muslims place importance on Muhammad and the Quran as they believe they were the first of their kind. In China, they believe history started with the Xia and Shan dynasties. Indians and Hindus credit ancient Indian astronomers with ideas about atomic energy, rockets, and missiles.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Claims of superiority and progress have been made by the British, Germans, Americans, Russians, and Japanese, who claim to have freed people from primitive and immoral ignorance. Jewish rabbis are attributed with the study of religious literature that supposedly prevents the universe from collapsing, a belief shared by the Aztec people.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inventions have also been attributed to Jews, including the Hebrew alphabet and the creation of yoga poses.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Nationalists in Turkey, Iran, and Egypt claim that their countries were the purest places of Islam before the time of Muhammad and the Quran.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>However, it is important to recognize that these claims are not necessarily true. They often stem from selfishness and racism, leading to civil wars and conflicts. People tend to overlook their own flaws and lack humility.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Those who place themselves in a more modern setting and time period are often being conceited and proud. However, all humans have the capacity for right and wrong and possess creativity. These qualities are ingrained in our DNA.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. The author claims, “Since it is more polite to criticise one’s own people than to criticise foreigners.” Do you agree to his claim? Give your reasons.</strong></p> <p>I agree with the author. There are some good reasons for this:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>People are naturally very proud of their own history, culture and religion. Criticism from outsiders can easily offend them.</p> <p>Issues within one's own society can be addressed by self-criticism in a respectful manner. This allows for improvements to be made without conflict.</p> <p>The author gives examples why some Aztec beliefs like human sacrifice were unreasonable. Non-Aztecs protesting this could have caused cultural tensions.</p> <p>It is better for a society to identify flaws themselves and work to resolve them, rather than outsiders pointing them out. This allows for progress through self-reflection rather than feeling attacked by foreigners.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Overall, self-criticism leaves room for respectful dialogue and improvements, avoiding potential conflicts from criticism by outsiders. The author's view encourages positive cultural exchange over friction.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

"reward": "<p><strong>Summary</strong></p> <p>The essay starts with a story about a rich king named Croesus. He ruled his kingdom well and took care of everyone's basic needs like health, food, water and vacations. The kingdom was like a perfect place as imagined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights from 1948 that aimed to give all people basic rights.</p><p><br /></p><p>The essay talks about how today our world is becoming like Croesus's kingdom. Most events, movements, rights focus to ensuring people can afford basic needs. But it notes that the gap between rich and poor is very large. Both the Declaration and rights movement did not focus on reducing this gap.</p><p><br /></p><p>The author argues that even if all rights are given, big inequality can still exist as long as a minimum level of inequality is there. This experiment questions if we should keep idealizing a world like Croesus's with growing inequality despite respecting rights.</p><p><br /></p><p>It looks at the historical connection between rights and economy. In the post-World War 2 time, countries focused on social rights and reducing inequality through welfare states. Even capitalist nations agreed some control was needed on inequality along with basic rights. The consensus was among nations on socio-economic rights and reducing inequality through welfare states. But this was done nationally rather than internationally.</p><p><br /></p><p>The author discusses how rights have limited success in addressing inequality. The tools of rights movements are not enough to solve economic issues globally. Real redistribution from rich to poor is needed, which naming and shaming alone cannot do.</p><p><br /></p><p>In conclusion, the essay suggests a very different new kind of rights is required to challenge growing inequality effectively. It raises the debate if rights movements should change themselves or wait for others to take on inequality. For now, the world continues to look like Croesus's kingdom with rising differences in wealth.</p> <p><br /></p> "

      "story": "<p> A Matter of Husbands </p> <br/><br/><p>Written by Shriram Lamichhane | © The SR Zone</p><p><br /></p><p>Understanding the text&nbsp;</p> <p>Answer the following questions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>a. What favour does Earnest Young Woman ask from The Famous Actress?</strong></p> <p>The Earnest Young Woman asks the Famous Actress to give back her husband.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. What, according to The Earnest Young Woman, are the indications that her husband has fallen in love with a Famous Actress?</strong></p> <p>According to The Earnest Young Woman, the signs that her husband has fallen in love with the Famous Actress are a love letter written by her husband to the actress and flowers sent to the actress.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Is Earnest Young Woman convinced by the argument of Famous Actress? How?</strong></p> <p>Yes, the Earnest Young Woman is convinced by the Famous Actress' explanation. She kisses the Famous Actress to show that she believes what the actress said.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Where is the Earnest Young Woman's husband hiding himself as they are talking to him?</strong></p> <p>The Earnest Young Woman's husband is hiding in the bedroom of the famous actress.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. When do you feel that a Famous Actress is really good at acting?</strong></p> <p>I think she is a very good actress. The Famous Actress explains to the Earnest Young Woman that her husband was just trying to make her jealous to get attention, not that he loves the actress. I was surprised when the husband came out of the room.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. How do we come to know that a Famous Actress and the husband of Earnest Young Woman are in love?</strong></p> <p>We realize they are in love when the Famous Actress calls out to the Earnest Young Woman's husband to come out of the bedroom.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>G. Write down the plot of the play in a paragraph.</strong></p> <p>Initially, the Earnest Young Woman angrily asks the Famous Actress to return her husband. The actress denies taking her husband. She says she knew him from a case before. The young woman says her husband wrote love letters and sent flowers to the actress. She reads one of the letters aloud. The actress denies getting any letters or flowers but later says the husband was just trying to make his wife jealous to get her attention. The young woman realizes her mistake and apologizes. After she gets convinced, the famous actress calls the husband out from her bedroom.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Reference to the context&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>a. Sketch the character of a Famous Actress.</strong></p> <p>The famous actress is a very clever woman who is aware of her beauty and popularity. On the surface she acts innocent but she is actually cunning and manipulative. She deceives people by telling lies. In this play, she tricks the earnest young woman by telling her that her husband is just trying to make her jealous, even though he is actually having an inappropriate relationship with the famous actress.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Shed light on the difference between an ordinary woman and an actress.</strong></p> <p>An ordinary woman like the earnest young woman is straightforward but also gullible and easy to trick. She believes everything the famous actress tells her without question. When the actress gives an excuse for the husband's behavior, the ordinary woman accepts it happily and doesn't see through the deception. On the other hand, the famous actress is much more cunning and intelligent. She can manipulate situations and mislead others through clever lies.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. According to Famous Actress, men associated with theatre use the theatre actresses to make their estranged wives jealous so as to woo them back. Do you agree with her argument? Why? Why not?</strong></p> <p>No, I don't think the famous actress's explanation is true. While making the wife jealous could be a tactic to win her back, in this case it seems the husband and actress were actually having an improper relationship. The wife was probably right that there was more going on between them than the actress admitted. Simple jealousy games don't usually involve hiding together privately like they were.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. How does a Famous Actress make a fool of Earnest Young Woman?</strong></p> <p>The famous actress tricks the earnest young woman by convincingly telling her that her husband was just trying to provoke her jealousy to get her attention, not that he loves the actress. The earnest woman believes this lie and thanks the actress, not realizing she has been deceived.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. The conversation between the two women takes place on the stage of the theatre. What role does the theatre house as a part of setting play in A Matter for Husband.</strong></p> <p>The theatre setting provided privacy for the two women to openly discuss personal matters. Having the conversation backstage instead of in a public place allowed them to freely exchange views on the sensitive topic of the husband's behavior.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. What do you think about the ending of the play?</strong></p> <p>In the end of the play, I felt surprised by all the twists. The actress tells the young lady that her husband was lying and just wanted to make her jealous. Young lady thinks everything is okay now. She believes she got her husband back, but in reality, her husband was still with the actress in secret relationship. They tricked the young lady.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>While the young lady feels happy, the ending is bittersweet because she doesn't know the truth. The clever actress and Alfred were not honest with her. The play shows that smart people can deceive nice people by lying to them. Nice people are often trusting, so they get hurt without knowing.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Overall, I found the ending thought-provoking. It makes me think about how honesty is better, but sometimes honest people face troubles because of lies from others.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference beyond the text</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>a. Write a paragraph describing your favourite actor/actress.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>My Favorite Actor : Tom Cruise</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>I really like Tom Cruise as an actor. If I could create the perfect actor, it would be just like him. He has a lot of different skills and is always excited about his work. He has been in many movies like Mission: Impossible, The Mummy, and Top Gun. He can act in a subtle way or be really over-the-top, and he's great at both. He's also really funny when he does stand-up comedy. When he acts, he always keeps my attention. Plus, he's the best at doing action scenes. He's a hardworking movie star and he's definitely at the top of my favorite actors list.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. John Cassavetes says, “I’m very worried about the depiction of women on the screen. It’s gotten worse than ever and it’s related to their being either high- or low-class concubines . . . . There’s nothing to do with the dreams of women, or of woman as the dream, nothing to do with the quirky part of her, the wonder of her.” How do you assess Famous Actress in the light of Cassavetes’ argument about the portrayal of women?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Cassavetes said movies often show women as either fancy or cheap, without showing their true depth. To see if \"Famous Actress\" agrees with this, we need to look at the female characters. Do they go beyond stereotypes and have their own goals and choices in the story? Do they show different experiences that break traditional ideas about women? By checking these things, we can see if the movie addresses Cassavetes' concern about how women are portrayed in films.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

Where does the play take place?</strong></p> <p>The play takes place in the dining room of Monsieur Durand's boarding house.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Why do the grocery, the baker and the butcher send their bills to the Durand household?</strong></p> <p>The grocery, baker, and butcher have to send their bills to Durand's home because he has not paid them for a long time. They can no longer provide more services until the unpaid invoices are paid.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Why does Monsieur Duran spend money on candles when he doesn’t have money to buy even bread?</strong></p> <p>On the anniversary of losing his baby son René, Monsieur Durand buys candles instead of food. He misses his departed son and wants to remember him, even though his family lacks basic needs.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Why did Monsieur Duran sell his life insurance?</strong></p> <p>Monsieur Durand wanted to use the money from selling his life insurance to pay off his debts.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. Why has Monsieur Duran paid fire insurance?</strong></p> <p>Monsieur Durand took a new fire insurance policy so that he could claim money if his home caught fire. He plans to burn down the house himself to get the insurance money, which he needs to support his children.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. How did Monsieur Duran and Mrs. Duran run out of their inheritances from both sides?</strong></p> <p>Mrs. Durand wasted the money they inherited from both families through reckless spending and bad investments. This money was meant to raise their daughters but is now all used up.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. Why does Monsieur Durand tell a lie about his birthplace?</strong></p> <p>Monsieur Durand lies about where he was born for two reasons. One, he fought against his home country France from Switzerland which embarrasses him. Two, he wants to protect his and his wife's reputation after marrying a much younger woman and moving away from his hometown.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. What business is Monsieur Durand running to make a living?</strong></p> <p>To earn money, Monsieur Durand runs a boarding house ( like a lodge or hotel ) business by renting rooms in his home.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>i. What plan does Monsieur Durand have to help his daughters with money?</strong></p> <p>Monsieur Durand plans to take his own life and burn down his home to claim the fire insurance money. He wants to use this money to support his three daughters after he passes away.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>j. How does Monsieur Durand die?</strong></p> <p>Monsieur Durand dies by consuming poison after setting fire in his house. He did this so his daughters would receive the life insurance payout after his death.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>REFERENCE TO THE CONTEXT</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Sketch the character of Monsieur Durand.</strong></p> <p>Monsieur Durand is the central character of the play. He is a retired railroad worker and owns a lodge which is also home to him and his three young daughters. He is bankrupt and in deep financial crisis. Though struggling with money problems, he is a loving, caring and protective father. His daughters are unhappy with him due to the family's miserable condition. Most of the time, the daughters dislike and blame him for everything. However, he keeps thinking about their well-being and will never give up on them. He sacrifices himself to protect his daughters, even if they don't like him. Throughout all struggles, he remains very patient and kind.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. How do we know that the Durand family has reached a dead end?</strong></p> <p>We know the Durand family hit dead end because of their financial struggles. For years they have survived on loans from friends and relatives. The family has huge debts to many creditors. Due to not having enough money, they turned their home into an inn to make some money. Durand's situation is the worst in the family. His daughters hate him and blame him for all problems. At times they don't even share food or drink with him, showing their anger. He is so poor that he eats rat's food due to hunger. Still, he tries his best in the difficult situation. Ultimately, Durand decides to end his life to save his daughter by taking an insurance amount.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. ‘The mother, though already dead, seems to have had a great influence on the daughters, especially Theresa.’ Do you agree?</strong></p> <p>Yes, I agree with this statement. We learn that the mother influenced her daughters a lot before she passed away, especially Theresa. The mother made the daughters dislike their father while she was alive. She ordered the daughters to always listen to her and blame their father. Because of the mother's words, all three daughters don't like their father now and blame him for everything bad. Theresa, in particular, seems to hate her father the most as she is always rude to him even now. So it's clear the mother's teachings and behavior significantly shaped how the daughters, especially Theresa, feel about their father.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Discuss the relationship between Monsieur Duran and his wife.</strong></p> <p>Monsieur Durand and his wife had a stressful marriage. However, his wife was responsible for destroying the family during her lifetime through her reckless decisions and actions. She wasted money on lotteries and even threatened to become a sex worker once. She filled her daughters with negativity and turned them completely against their father by blaming him for everything. She successfully managed to divert her daughters' attention and create hatred in them towards their father.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. ‘Money determines the relationship between characters in this play.’ Elaborate this statement with examples from the play.</strong></p> <p>In the play, we see how lack of money damaged relationships. Durand cannot afford his daughters' needs so they transformed their home into a lodge. His relationship with his wife deteriorated due to huge property loss. The girls hate their father as he cannot support them financially.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Whenever Durand promises money, the daughters treat him nicely with affection. But otherwise, they disrespect him by grabbing his food and cigarettes. The characters' connections are defined by financial issues in the drama.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. Monsieur Durand killed himself so that his daughters would get 5000 francs as compensation from the insurance company. What does his plan tell us about him?</strong></p> <p>Mr. Durand has faced poverty all his life. Due to the economic crisis, his daughters blamed him often for their troubles. People saw him as a bad father since he couldn't raise his children well financially. However, his plan shows he is a very loving father who sacrifices himself for his daughters' secure future with the insurance money. His death ensures financial support for the young girls.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. Discuss Facing Death as a modern tragedy.</strong></p> <p>In modern tragedy, play explores tragic events and concludes with an unhappy ending, particularly involving the downfall of the main character. The play \"Facing Death\" can be considered a modern tragedy because it concludes with the tragic death of the protagonist, Mr. Durand. Modern tragedies often tackle realistic situations and common issues faced by people.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Reference beyond the text</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Write a few paragraphs describing the role of the father in the family.</strong></p> <p>In Nepalese households, fathers hold a significant role due to the country's patriarchal traditions and beliefs. They are traditionally regarded as the social and political protectors of the family.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In a Nepali family, the father plays the most important role and sets the standards for the family's activities. His presence creates a sense of stability for the entire household. As the primary earner, the father is responsible for the well-being of his family. He takes on the role of the primary caregiver, ensuring the welfare of his loved ones.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As a parent, the father's role includes guiding and leading his children on the path of righteousness. He plays a crucial part in building their self-esteem. It is the father who imparts the values of the family's culture, traditions, and customs to his children. Fathers establish guidelines for their children's prosperous future.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The emotional well-being of children is significantly influenced by their fathers' involvement. Fathers also support their children's academic pursuits. They set examples for how to interact with others. Fathers often face numerous challenges in order to provide for their families. They provide both physical and emotional stability for their children.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

Why have Gore and Jitman come to see Laxminarayan?</strong></p> <p>Gore and Jitman have come to tell Laxminarayan about King Ranabahadur Shah's bull (Male) who has died.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. What, according to cowherds, is the reason behind the death of Male?</strong></p> <p>According to the cowherds, the reason behind Male's death is that he was starving and unable to digest the basic foods of fine rice and split gram.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Why does Ranabahadur want to see the bull himself?</strong></p> <p>Ranabahadur wants to personally meet the bull to verify its health status himself. He doesn't want the bull to be brought to the hill if it has been treated or healed at Thulo Gauchar in Kathmandu.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Why does Laxminarayan run ahead of the convoy at Thulo Gaucharan?</strong></p> <p>At Thulo Gaucharan, Laxminarayan runs ahead of the convoy to instruct the cowherds to massage the bull's rear feet and wave fans at it. This is to impress King Ranabahadur Shah and show how much care they have taken of the bull. Otherwise, the king would get furious and punish the cowherds.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. Why do Gore and Jitman cry when the king declares that Male is dead?</strong></p> <p>Gore and Jitman cry when the king declares Male dead to demonstrate their fake affection and concern for the bull. They hope this will help them escape the king's anger, as he could punish them for the death of his bull otherwise.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. How do we learn that the bull is dead?</strong></p> <p>We learn that the bull is dead from what the cowherds and king tell us - that the bull is not breathing, its tail and ears have fallen, and it is not eating.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. How does the play make a satire on the feudal system?</strong></p> <p>The play depicts the dehumanization and oppression faced by common people under feudal rulers. The lord's animal is treated better than people. It shows how the feudal system has suppressed and dominated people, who live in fear and must survive on the lord's kindness, like the cowherds. This satirizes the abuse in the feudal social structure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>REFERENCE TO THE CONTEXT&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Discuss the late eighteenth-century Nepali society as portrayed in terms of the relation between the king and his subjects as portrayed in the play.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The play shows that Nepal followed a monarchy system in the 1800s under the Shah Dynasty. There were strict rules and people had to follow them. The king and soldiers commanded absolute authority and obedience. The rulers like kings and lords represented a cruel society where people suffered. Common citizens had little understanding of politics. People were punished for not paying respects to the rulers. They faced consequences for revolting against the abusive authoritarian rulers. Fundamental rights were denied. Women were subservient to men. Polygamy was practiced where males had multiple wives. The monarchs and lords dominated the lives of ordinary people.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. What does the relation between Laxminarayan and his wives tell us about the society of that time? To what extent has the Nepali society changed since then?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Laxminarayan, who is 40 years old, has been married to seven women throughout his life. Despite having seven wives, he is unhappy and wants an eighth marriage. He disrespectfully calls his wives by insulting nicknames, showing patriarchal attitudes. This depicts a society where gender roles were rigid with men superior and women inferior. Married women were enslaved to husbands. Illiteracy, child marriage, poverty and lack of education caused many issues. Polygamy was prevalent where women relied on men and spent time indoors.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Today, Nepali society has vastly transformed. Women's awareness, education and representation in top jobs have increased tremendously. The constitution ensures equal rights and punishes gender discrimination. Society is no longer male-dominated, and women can survive independently.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Shed light on the practice of chakari as portrayed in the play. Have you noticed this practice in your society?</strong></p> <p>In the play \"The Bull\", many characters like Laxminarayn Dahal, Gore and Jitman serve King Ranabahadur Shah through the practice of chakari. This refers to pleasing superiors by being fearful and polite.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Laxminarayn is skilled at chakari and has faced punishment before for displeasing the King. The cowherds also fear the King and act cautiously around the dead bull, massaging its feet and fanning it to appease him. When speaking to the King, they refer to the bull respectfully as \"The Bull Sir\".</p> <p><br /></p> <p>So the play focuses a lot on showing how chakari was used historically as people feared angering their rulers. In modern Nepal, you've noticed people still do chakari but more to politicians rather than kings. Nowadays, people use chakari seeking personal benefits like money, status and wealth from politicians rather than just avoiding punishment.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In summary, the play portrays historical chakari out of fear of kings, while today chakari is used more for self-interest when dealing with politicians in Nepal.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. How does Laxminarayan outsmart Ranabahadur?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>When Laxminarayan learns about the bull's death, he goes to the palace and uses his skill of flattery (chakari) without revealing the reality. He tells the king the bull was ill, not dead. He instructs the cowherds to act like they treated the bull well. The king believes their story and is not furious since Laxminarayan cleverly diverted him. Through his tactics, he protects himself and cowherds from the king's wrath.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. Sketch the character of Laxminarayan.</strong></p> <p>Laxminarayan is the central character who works as King Rana Bahadur's bull doctor and legal officer. Despite having 7 wives, he is unhappy and plans an 8th marriage. When the king's bull dies, he uses his intelligence to save himself and cowherds from the king's anger through his skills of flattery and tactfully diverting the king's focus. He is well-versed in pleasing the king through chakari. He outsmarts the authoritarian king with his clever strategies.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>REFERENCE BEYOND THE TEXT&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Write an essay in about 300 words on “The Nepali Society: Past, Present and Future”.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Nepali Society: Past, Present and Future</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>The term \"society\" refers to a group of people who have shared cultural characteristics, such as language, clothing, social norms, and artistic expressions. However, cultural practices often blend, and individuals from different cultures may adopt each other's customs.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Over the years, Nepali society has undergone significant changes. Feudalism was prevalent in the country's history, and both women and the general population faced challenges. They relied on kings or rulers for their livelihoods. Women, in particular, faced difficulties during this period. Life was tough for most peasants, and child marriages were common. Society was highly strict and rigid in its norms.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In the past, the destiny of people was determined by feudal lords, and limited resources hindered their lives. They had little awareness of individual rights and opportunities. Women were confined to their homes due to patriarchal customs and ideals, which were dominant at the time. The lives of common people were difficult under the feudal system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>However, Nepalese society today is quite different from the past. The situation of Nepali women has improved significantly. People now enjoy a wide range of freedoms and rights. The Nepali constitution has granted women significant privileges over the years. Nepal has witnessed progress in various sectors, including electricity, access to clean drinking water, improved roads and transportation, and enhanced educational opportunities. Nepalese society is on a path of progress.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The political aspect of Nepali society holds great influence in shaping its future. It is important to set aside political differences and focus on the bright future of the Nepali people and the country as a whole. With careful selection of capable leaders, Nepal's future can be promising.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. In his “Satire 9”, Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux says:</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong><em>But satire, ever moral, ever new</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Delights the reader and instructs him, too.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>She, if good sense, refine her sterling page,</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Oft shakes some rooted folly of the age.</em></strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Do you agree with the poet? Discuss the lines with reference to Bhimnidhi Tiwari’s play “The Bull”.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>I agree with poet's perspective on satire. A well-crafted piece of satire has the ability to entertain and educate its audience. It can expose the errors and shortcomings of a particular era or system if it is written with a positive purpose in mind.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\"The Bull\" by Bhimnidhi Tiwari sounds like a powerful example of satire. By satirizing the feudal system, which reduces human beings to a state where their lives are dependent on the respectful treatment of animals like bulls, Tiwari sheds light on the societal dynamics of that time. Through humor, the author provides a comprehensive portrayal of the society, highlighting both its positive and negative aspects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Satire, when used effectively, can serve as a tool to critique and improve various aspects of society. It has the potential to challenge prevailing norms, raise awareness, and encourage positive change.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

He does not say the bull has died. Instead, he lies that the bull is sick and should go to hills to get better treatment.</p><p><br /></p><p>The king agrees to visit where the bull is kept to see his condition. Laxminarayan cleverly tells the cowherds to pretend the bull is still alive by moving its feet and fanning it before king sees the bull. When the king sees the bull, he announces being upset that it has died, not sick. But he praises the cowherds for taking care of it.</p><p><br /></p><p>Laxminarayan pretended to be hurt by the news. But the king saw through his acting. He scolded Laxminarayan for not being genuine. The king then told Laxminarayan to organize the bull's funeral properly. He had to make offerings to the priest as part of the ceremonies. The king wanted the bull respected, even in death.</p><p><br /></p><p>The play shows how people had to serve powerful kings like animals in old times. The king cared more for his bull than people. It satirizes or criticizes the unfair feudal system.</p> <p><br /></p> "

Have you made your own precept after you read this lesson? What is it? Share it with your friends.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>= Precept is a rule or principle that we make to conduct our behaviour in accordance with that. I also had many precepts even before reading this lesson. The major precepts of my life are:&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>'Anything that happens, happens for good'</span></p> <p><span>'Always stay Positive'</span></p> <p><span> 'Believe in Karma rather than fate'</span></p> <p><span> 'What we are today is the result the choices we made yesterday, so we have to make choices wisely'</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>These are some of the precepts which I don't only think are ideal but also try to ideally follow them in my daily behaviours.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. According to Josh Lanyon, “If there was one life skill everyone on the planet needed, it was the ability to think with critical objectivity.” Justify this statement with your logic.</strong></p> <p><span>=&nbsp;</span>Josh Lanyon said that the most useful life skill is being able to think critically without bias. Critical thinking lets us look at information objectively so we can decide what's best without emotions getting in the way. This helps with all kinds of choices in life. It helps us break big problems down and look at possible solutions fairly. This is important for dealing with challenges. Many fights happen because of misunderstandings if we see different sides. Critical thinking helps understand other views to fix problems in a constructive way. In online world, it's hard to tell what's real because of too much info and opinions. Critical thinking helps us separate facts from nonsense.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In conclusion, being able to analyze without prejudice is a very useful skill that helps in life in many important areas like decisions, education, relationships and being a responsible community member.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Grammar</strong></p> <p><strong>Question Tag</strong></p> <p><strong>B.

Yesterday we covered the topic of renewable energy sources in my Environmental Science class.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Our professor started the lecture by going over the different types of renewable energy like solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass. It was fascinating to learn about the science behind how each one generates electricity. For example, did you know that solar panels work by using the photovoltaic effect to convert sunlight directly into electricity?</p> <p><br /></p> <p>After the overview, we spent the rest of the class doing a group project where we had to imagine designing a full renewable energy system for a small town. My group chose to focus on wind and solar. We researched the average wind speeds and sunlight hours for the area and used that data to calculate how many wind turbines and solar panel arrays we would need. Then we had to figure out the best locations to install them based on land availability, proximity to the towns power grid, and other factors.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>It was really interesting to think through the real-world challenges of transitioning an entire community to clean energy. Our professor said most of the work we did could actually be applied to real renewable energy projects. Overall it was one of the most engaging classes I've had so far.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Let me know if you have any other questions! I'm looking forward to learning more about this important topic.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Talk to you soon,</p> <p>SR</p> <p><br /></p>     "

The headings of the first five paragraphs of the above text are given below. Write paragraph numbers next to them.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>a. Patriarchal family &nbsp;= 3rd Paragraph</span></p> <p><span>b. Functions of the family = 2nd Paragraph</span></p> <p><span>c. Modern model of family = 5th Paragraph</span></p> <p><span>d.

Answer the following questions.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;a. What type of family is thought to be the oldest form of the family?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>=&nbsp;</span>The oldest form of the family is known as a nuclear family. It consists of parents and their children and is considered the earliest type of family.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. How does a family provide security to its members?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>= Security is a major benefit of a family, both physically and mentally. If necessary, a strong family will provide protection against pressures from the outside world and provide its members the confidence they need to confront various challenges.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. What were the features of a medieval European family?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>= The main feature of the Medieval European family is that it was male-dominated and extended.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. What caused the dissolution of extended families in the West?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>= When it comes to changing family structures in Western countries, industrialisation is the main reason, along with urbanization has brought about and continues to bring about numerous new developments. Unmarried youths in particular abandoned rural areas to work in factories in metropolitan areas. As a result of this procedure, a number of extended families were dissolved.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. What change occurred in gender roles in the modern family that emerged after the Industrial Revolution?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>= Originarily, the industrial revolution led to a domestication of women, as men went to occupations in other sectors and women were expected to care for the children. Similarly, Family responsibilities that were previously believed to be entirely male or female were changed into shared responsibilities.

What changes have started to occur in Nepali families in recent days? What impacts will they bring on society? Discuss.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>=&nbsp;</span>Nepali families are changing in today's world. While traditions of the past still have influence, new ways are developing.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In the past, things like marriage were decided more by parents. Now young people often choose their own partners, like through schools or friend groups. Divorce is more common too as people make their own choices.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Families used to live together with parents, children and grandparents all under one roof. Now more young couples want their own small family, just parents and kids. This nuclear family is separate from other relatives.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Women have more freedoms now. They aren't just stuck at home, they can work or study too. In families, men and women share responsibilities and decisions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>A nuclear family means the kids are closer to parents. Parents can make their own rules too. It is also easier financially sometimes for a small family. Moms have more time just for kids.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>But there are downsides too. Alone in a nuclear family, there is no help from grandparents or others in emergencies. Kids miss out on learning culture and values from all relatives together. Moms have a lot to do alone without support. Dads work long hours too, so kids can feel lonely or neglected.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Overall, Nepali families and society are adjusting to these new changes in family structures and roles. Both benefits and challenges arise from women's roles expanding and families becoming more nuclear and independent. Traditions from the past continue to shape things too in this transition period.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. We see many elderly people in the elderly homes these days in Nepal. Some of them are abandoned while others live there willingly. Do you think Nepali people are deviating from their traditional culture? Give reasons.</strong></p> <p><span>=&nbsp;</span>Nowadays in Nepal, we see a lot of elderly people living in homes for the elderly. Some of them have been abandoned by their families, while others choose to live there. This situation makes us wonder if Nepali people are moving away from their traditional culture.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The truth is, many people in our society have become focused on making money and acquiring material possessions. In the past, we used to live in extended families where elders were respected and cherished. But now, with the rise of nuclear families and the trend of having only one child, things have changed. People prioritize their own happiness and often neglect everything else, including their elderly parents.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>This sad state of affairs for older people and the decline of family values can be attributed to the influence of Western culture and materialistic beliefs. Additionally, factors such as greed, the pursuit of education, and the process of industrialization have also contributed to the neglect of the elderly. People are busy with their jobs and have little time to take care of their aging parents. As a result, even parents themselves may choose not to live with their children out of fear of being neglected.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In conclusion, it's not that Nepali people are intentionally deviating from their traditional culture. Rather, the fast-paced nature of modern life, the demands of work, and the desire for small or nuclear families have led to the sorry state of older people in our society.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Writing</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Write an essay on The Importance of Family.</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Importance of Family</strong></p> <p>The family is the basic unit of society and plays a pivotal role in everyone's life. A strong family provides love, care, support, and guidance to its members. It helps shape our character and personality from a young age. Family teaches us important values like compassion, sharing, honesty and respect.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Family is very important to me. My family provides unconditional love, support and acceptance. No matter what challenges I face, I know I can count on them. They have been there through all my happy and difficult times.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Family is also important for society. Strong families create a stable community. Children raised in caring families do better and become productive adults. Families teach values like kindness and responsibility. When families struggle, it can lead to issues like poverty and crime.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In the future, family structures may change with technology. Not as many people may have traditional families. Long distance relationships may be more common due to globalization. However, family will still be essential. While families may look different, the love and support of family will remain key for people's well-being.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In conclusion, family is critical both personally and for society. Personally, my family means everything to me. And communities rely on strong families too. Even as society changes with time, family will always be hugely important for individual lives and the greater good of all. Cherishing family relationships remains key.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Some individuals believe that living in a nuclear family is preferable. Others believe that living with extended relatives is preferable. What are your thoughts? Write an essay comparing and contrasting the benefits and drawbacks of each.</strong></p> <p>There are two main types of family living arrangements - nuclear families and extended families. A nuclear family typically consists of parents and children, while an extended family includes additional relatives like grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins living together.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Nuclear families have some advantages. Living on your own provides privacy and independence where each person has their own space. It also promotes close relationships between parents and children since attention is not divided among other relatives. However, nuclear families can lack a wider support system and feelings of loneliness may occur especially as parents get older without other family help.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Extended families also have benefits. A larger household means a stronger support system where relatives can help each other financially, emotionally and with caregiving duties. Kids get to learn and bond across generations. Living together fosters a sense of community and belonging within the family.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>But extended families can come with disadvantages too. Having many people together under one roof risks disagreements and loss of personal boundaries. Independence and alone time is reduced in a big household.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ultimately, the best option depends on individual needs, cultures and situations. Some value independence of nuclear families more while others prefer the companionship of extended families. Open communication within the family is important to make either arrangement work well. Both can be good if handled properly to support family bonding and well-being.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Grammar&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Modal verbs&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>A.

Ask them what they had expected from their children and what actually happened. Prepare a story and present it to the class.</strong></p> <p>Good morning everyone. My group and I recently had the opportunity to speak with an elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Singh, as part of our project on understanding the expectations and realities of care for the elderly.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>When they were younger, the Singhs hoped that in their old age, they would be able to live peacefully with their children and grandchildren surrounding them. They looked forward to imparting their wisdom and being able to help out with childcare occasionally. Their expectation was that their children would take care of them financially and emotionally in their retirement.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Unfortunately, reality turned out to be quite different. Both their children now have careers in different cities far away due to job opportunities. While they visit on holidays, the Singhs mentioned it's a struggle with health issues living alone now. They rely on a fixed pension income which is becoming insufficient with rising living costs. Although their children send some money, it does not cover all expenses.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Loneliness and lack of regular company have been difficult to cope with. Simple tasks like grocery shopping or visiting the doctor have become challenging without any help. Both their mental and physical health has declined significantly living apart from family in their old apartment.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>By sharing their story, the Singhs hope to create more awareness about the hardships faced by many elderly people who are separated from children. The experience has been very emotionally distressing for them to see their expectations of care and support in old age unmet. They wish that families could find a way to look after aging parents even with other commitments.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In conclusion, this story highlights the importance of fulfilling filial responsibilities and the impact on quality of life when expectations are not met. I hope it provides a window into the challenges the elderly population faces. Thank you for listening to our presentation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> "

State whether the following sentences are True or False or Not Given.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>a. England was the champion of 1996 World Cup Football. =&nbsp;</span><strong><em>False</em></strong></p> <p><span>b. Italy bagged its first Euro Cup trophy in the Euro Cup 2020.&nbsp;</span><strong><em>= False</em></strong></p> <p><span>c. The English team has won more trophies in International Football than Italy. =&nbsp;</span><strong><em>False</em></strong></p> <p><span>d. According to the captain of the English team, the pain of losing a match has lasting effects. =&nbsp;</span><strong><em>True</em></strong></p> <p><span>e. The Italian team was playing in their home ground. =&nbsp;</span><strong><em>False</em></strong></p> <p><span>f. The goalkeeper of the Italian team had performed better than any other players in the match. =&nbsp;</span><strong><em>Not given</em></strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>B. Answer the following questions.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>a) Why does the reporter say that England is waiting to heal its half-century long pain?</strong></p> <p>The reporter says England is waiting to heal its long pain because the last time England won a major football tournament match was in 1966. The long pain means being sad and disappointed about losing many matches for a long time.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b) How did the Italian players react as soon as they became the champions?</strong></p> <p>As soon as Italy became the champions, the Italian players started happily shouting 'It's coming to Rome' which is their capital city. They were jokingly copying the song of the English football team which means football is coming home.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c) Why did Saka and Sancho cry?</strong></p> <p>Saka and Sancho cried because England lost the match in the penalty shootout. Both players missed their penalty kicks which helped Italy win.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d) Penalty shoot-out has long been a bitter experience for the English team. Why?</strong></p> <p>England loses many matches in penalty shootouts. In Euro 2020, the young player Saka missed the last penalty kick which let Italy win. Other England players like Rashford and Sancho also missed penalty kicks before. This happened three times, so penalty shootouts always end badly for England.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e) State the contribution of Roberto Mancini to Italian football.</strong></p> <p>Under Roberto Mancini, the Italian football team became very successful. He made them a strong professional team that plays good defense like before but encourages the players. Only 4 years ago Italy didn't qualify for the World Cup but now they are European champions with a long winning streak. Mancini gave the players confidence to win Euro 2020.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f) How does the Euro Cup final 2020 remind the audiences of the 2018 World Cup semifinals? How?</strong></p> <p>The 2020 Euro Cup final between Italy and England reminded audiences of the 2018 World Cup semifinals between England and Croatia. In 2018, England scored early but Croatia controlled the midfield until Croatia scored late in extra time to win. The 2020 final was similar as Italy controlled after England's early goal.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Critical thinking&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;a. 'Every match is a new opportunity. Put its failure behind you and start over again.' Does this apply to the Italian football team when we analyse their performance from their failure to qualify for the World Cup Football to their victory in the European Championship in these four years?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Yes, this applies to the Italian football team. After failing to qualify for the World Cup, the team worked very hard for four years to improve. They had a positive attitude and never gave up. Under coach Roberto Mancini, the players developed their skills and strategies. Even after losses, they learned from their mistakes and focused on the next game. Through dedication and teamwork, they were able to win the Euro Cup. So the Italian team was able to turn their failure into success by taking every match as a new chance to improve.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. When a team plays in a home ground, it gets a huge support from the audience in the stadium. Does this support them to win the match or the players may feel pressure to win and thus lose? What do you think?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Usually, playing game in home ground and support helps a team play better and win. The encouragement from home fans gives players motivation and confidence. However, sometimes players may also feel pressure to win for their fans. If they are too anxious about not losing in front of the home crowd, it could negatively impact their game. They may make more mistakes due to nervousness. Overall, home support is generally an advantage, but players need to stay focused on playing their best without worrying too much about the result or what fans think. It's important for players to not feel over pressured and enjoy playing at home.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Writing</strong></p> <p><strong>A. Correct the punctuation marks of the following text.</strong></p> <p>A lot of people try to get away from home for a few days each year for a holiday. There are lots of things to choose from, and where you go depends on how much money you have got to spend. Ideas for holidays include relaxing on a beach, exploring cities, and skiing. One man wanted to go to Australia but thought he'd never have enough money to get there. He will go to his brother's caravan at the seaside instead. A young woman wanted to go clubbing in Ibiza as she'd heard it's a lot of fun.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>B. Write a news story based on the given information.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Title : Argentina beats Brazil in the COPA America Cup.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>By Reuters</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p>RIO DE JANEIRO - Argentina defeated host Brazil 1-0 tonight at the Maracana Stadium to win the Copa America, claiming their first major title in 28 years and denying Brazil a record-breaking 15th South American championship.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>An early goal from Angel Di Maria proved to be the difference as Argentina withstood heavy pressure from Brazil in the second half to secure victory. The win also delivers Argentina superstar Lionel Messi his first ever senior international trophy with the national team.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Di Maria scored in the 22nd minute after a gorgeous pass by Rodrigo De Paul. From outside the box, Di Maria sent a low, left-footed shot to the far corner, giving Argentina the lead.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Brazil came out aggressively after the break, pushing numbers forward in search of an equalizer. But Argentina's defense, led by man of the match Cristian Romero, stood tall against the hosts' attacks. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez also came up with several crucial saves late to preserve the one-goal advantage.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As the final whistle blew, jubilant Argentine players collapsed in celebration on the pitch after ending their 28-year wait for a trophy. For captain Messi, it marks international validation after years of club success with Barcelona. Brazil had chances but were unable to break down the resolute Argentine back line.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>With the victory, Argentina wins their 15th Copa America title, drawing level with Brazil for the most wins in the history of the tournament. It is a crushing defeat for Brazil on home soil and delivers Lionel Scaloni's Argentina side their first title since 1993.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>C. We can see many countries competing to host the great international sport events like the World Cup Football. But, there are arguments that hosting an event like World Cup Football can have more problems than benefits. What do you think? Write your arguments in favour or against hosting an international sport event in about 500 words.</strong></p> <p><strong>=</strong><span>&nbsp; Every coin has two sides.&nbsp;</span>There are reasonable arguments on both sides of this issue. Hosting a major international event like the FIFA World Cup can provide significant economic and publicity benefits to the host country and cities. However, it also requires massive investments of money and resources which do not always generate good returns.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>On the benefits side, a World Cup brings thousands of international visitors and media attention to the host nation. This influx of tourism spending can give a boost to the local hospitality and travel industries in cities hosting games. New hotels, transport infrastructure and facilities are often constructed to handle the spike in visitors, leaving a lasting legacy. Additionally, the prestigious image of hosting a global spectacle is seen as a point of national pride that can promote the host country on the world stage.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>However, the costs of hosting a World Cup are extremely high and often underestimated. Building or renovating huge stadiums, highways, airports, subway lines and other supporting infrastructure requires multibillion-dollar investments by host governments that may not generate an adequate economic return. Many of the construction projects are \"white elephants\" with little use after the event ends. Mega events have also been blamed for displacing local residents and small businesses to make way for new developments. There are also security and logistical challenges in hosting such a large-scale event, as proven by issues at past World Cups.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The late delivery or overbudget expenditures on infrastructure have plagued several past hosts like Brazil in 2014. This misuse of taxpayer money has led critics to argue that investment in education, healthcare or social services may have provided better long-term returns for citizens. There is also no guarantee that the expected tourism revenues will fully cover all event-related expenditures. Several economic studies point out the limited or short-term nature of any financial boost from these global sporting jamborees.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>On balance, while hosting a FIFA World Cup offers opportunities for national prestige and tourism income, the extraordinary costs are often too high for countries - especially developing nations - relative to the hard-to-predict economic benefits. A cost-benefit analysis studying concrete legacy outcomes is needed before a bid is launched to ensure taxpayer funds are well spent rather than wasted on \"white elephants\". With better planning and fiscal responsibility, international events can generate more profits relative to their price tag. But unrealistic projections of financial bonanzas should always be viewed skeptically.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In conclusion, while international sporting events offer publicity positives, the huge financial and social costs typically outweigh the benefits - especially in smaller developing countries. More rigorous cost-benefit analyses are needed before nations commit billions to hosting a global jamboree that may just become an expensive distraction from long-term social development priorities.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Grammar</strong></p> <p><strong>Countable = few</strong></p> <p><strong>Unountable = little</strong></p> <p><strong>Countable = few bhanda thorai badhi testo bela <em>a few</em> use garnus</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>B.

What is a hyperloop? How does it work?</strong></p> <p>A hyperloop is a high-speed train that travels inside a tube with no air. It can reach incredible speeds because there is no air resistance to slow it down.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. How is hyperloop more beneficial than traditional trains?</strong></p> <p>Hyperloop is better than traditional trains in many ways. It is cheaper and uses less energy because it doesn't need constant electricity. Also, hyperloop can operate like a demand-based service, with pods departing every 30 seconds.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Does hyperloop have a successful history? How?</strong></p> <p>No, hyperloop does not have a successful history. The original concept of using pneumatic tubes for transporting mail and parcels between buildings was a failure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Write the contributions of Robert Goddard and Elon Musk for the development of hyperloop.</strong></p> <p>In the early 20th century, Robert Goddard developed the concept of the \"vactrain,\" which is considered a precursor to the hyperloop. Elon Musk, the creator of SpaceX and Tesla, introduced the idea of the hyperloop as a fast transportation option. His publication called \"Hyperloop Alpha\" in 2013 sparked the concept of the hyperloop.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. What relation does speed have with air resistance? Explain.</strong></p> <p>Air resistance slows down a moving object, so the higher the air resistance, the slower the object will go. In the case of the hyperloop, since it travels through vacuum tubes with no air, it can achieve very high speeds due to the absence of air resistance.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. What are hyperloop capsules compared with? How are they similar?</strong></p> <p>Hyperloop capsules are compared to Boeing 747s because they both accelerate at the same rate of speed.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. How do passengers feel while traveling via hyperloop? What will be done to make it luxurious?</strong></p> <p>Passengers feel similar to riding in an elevator or a passenger aircraft when traveling in a hyperloop. The cabins offer beautiful scenery, and each passenger has their own private entertainment system to make the journey comfortable and enjoyable.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. Why does the writer doubt the success of hyperloop? What does success depend on?</strong></p> <p>The writer has doubts about the success of hyperloop because of the high costs involved and the fact that the projects are still in the experimental phase. Success depends on factors such as the destinations served, the local economy, and the geographical location. Past experiences with similar concepts have shown challenges in gaining government support, which raises concerns about the viability of hyperloop projects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Critical thinking</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Is the hyperloop the future of transportation or just a dream? What do you think? Justify your opinion with suitable reasons.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>= In my opinion, the hyperloop is indeed the future of transportation. When Elon Musk introduced the concept in 2013, it sparked a lot of excitement and was seen as a futuristic mass transportation system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>One of the most impressive aspects of the hyperloop is its ability to float in tubes just a few millimeters above the ground. This technology has the potential to significantly reduce travel times between cities while being more cost-effective and environmentally friendly compared to current transportation methods. By utilizing pneumatic steel tubes, the hyperloop can achieve supersonic speeds.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>However, there are still challenges to overcome. The development of the hyperloop is a costly endeavor, which may limit its accessibility to all types of travelers. Additionally, it is currently in the testing phase, and it takes time to fully realize its potential.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Despite these challenges, I believe that the hyperloop has the potential to revolutionize transportation. Throughout history, we have achieved remarkable feats and overcome seemingly impossible obstacles. If inventors and innovators succeed in their initiatives, the hyperloop could become the transportation method of the future.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. The number of private vehicles is increasing day by day in Nepal beyond the capacity of our infrastructure. What do you think should be done to curb the ever-growing number of private vehicles? Discuss.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>= Nepal is facing a rapid increase in the number of private vehicles, surpassing the capacity of its infrastructure. This rise in vehicle ownership poses significant challenges such as pollution, traffic congestion, and road accidents.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>To address this issue, we need to take several steps. Firstly, it is crucial to discourage the extensive use of private vehicles due to their negative environmental impact and contribution to harmful gas emissions. Public transit should be prioritized and promoted as a viable alternative.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Implementing regulations that limit the use of older personal vehicles by municipal authorities can be beneficial. Additionally, constructing new highways and expanding existing ones can help alleviate traffic congestion. Encouraging people to utilize public transportation, such as buses and trains, is essential.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Both the government and citizens must collaborate to achieve this goal. Effective management and planning are necessary to prevent further growth in the number of vehicles and mitigate their adverse impacts. While completely stopping individuals from purchasing and using personal vehicles may not be feasible, a shift towards prioritizing public transportation is crucial for sustainable transportation in the long run.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Writing</p> <p><strong>Suppose you are the General Manager of Nepal Airlines. Issue a press release on behalf of the airlines about the cancellation of flights to the mountain regions due to the poor weather condition.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Nepal Airlines Press Release</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Date: January 15, 2023</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Nepal Airlines Cancels Flights to Mountain Regions Due to Adverse Weather Conditions</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Kathmandu, Nepal - Nepal Airlines regrets to announce the cancellation of all scheduled domestic flights to mountain destinations effective immediately until further notice.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Due to the forecast of heavy snowfall and strong winds in high altitude locations across the country, all flights to and from Lukla, Jomsom, Pokhara and Jharkot among other mountain airstrips will not operate as planned. The safety of our passengers and crew members is of utmost importance to Nepal Airlines.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The meteorological department has issued warnings of blizzard-like conditions and near zero visibility over the next 48 hours which will hamper flight operations in mountainous terrain. Dense fog is also expected to reduce visibility at major airports.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>All passengers holding tickets to these cancelled destinations will be provided with full refunds or alternative flight arrangements at the earliest possible opportunity once the weather clears up.

After his arrival, one of his first tasks was to find an apartment close to work, as he did not have a car. Usually, there are many different places to choose from, and he considers cost, location, and luxury. If one apartment has a washing machine and dryer and costs four hundred dollars a month, he prefers to rent it over another apartment which has significantly less rent and is located two blocks from a Laundromat. Rob's family never wanted to live in an apartment on the thirteenth floor, since all of them fear heights. He also tried to choose an apartment with a landlord recommended by former tenants. Everybody knows that it is important to find a responsible landlord. Rob and his wife love to cook together when both are free, so they need a spacious, well-equipped kitchen. Rob often looks for a place with an air conditioner because there are so many scorching days and nights in Arizona. Whenever Rob finds a new apartment, all of his concerns disappear.

In our communities too, people used many traditional technologies which are no longer in practice. Meet some elderly people in your community and ask them about such technologies. Write a report and share it to the class.</strong></p> <p>Traditional Technologies Used by Elders in our Community</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Respected Teachers and Friends,</p> <p><br /></p> <p>I recently met with some elderly people in our community to learn about traditional technologies that were used in the past but are no longer in common practice. Here is a report of what I learned:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>I first spoke to 75-year old Dhan Maya Lama who recalled how villagers used to grind grains manually using stone mortar and pestle called jaatika. It was laborious work but an essential part of food preparation. Now electric grinders have replaced this traditional method.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>75-year old Lakh Bahadur Rai shared about how villagers extracted mustard oil in the past. Seeds were ground and pressed manually using a wooden machine called dhunki to extract the oil. This process does not require electricity unlike oil extraction machines used today.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>80-year old Om Kumari Magar told me that villagers made lemon juice, tomato ketchup and jam earlier by boiling fruits and vegetables over a wooden stove called chulha which burned firewood. These food items are now easily available commercially prepared.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Finally, 80-year old Tanka Devi Bhujel described how villagers communicated manually through tin or bamboo megaphones called datbaja or omkaashi to call people from a distance. Now we use mobile phones, radios and other technologies for communication.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In conclusion, our elders performed various tasks using traditional technologies based on locally available materials that required manual labor but met their daily needs. While modern machines have made work easier, we must acknowledge and appreciate the indigenous knowledge and skills of our forefathers.</p> <p><br /></p> "

Why did Abdul Kalam have to split with his intimate friend?</strong></p> <p><span>The school at Rameswaram only offered courses up to the secondary level, thus Abdul Kalam and his close friend were forced to part ways since further education was only available in the surrounding larger cities.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. What was the topic of Sivasubramania Iyer’s class?</strong></p> <p><span>The topic of Sivasubramania Iyer class was on demonstrating how birds fly.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. How was the teacher’s reaction when the students told him that they did not understand his lecture?</strong></p> <p><span>Teacher was neither irritated nor furious with them when they reported that they didn't understand his lecture.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. Why did Sivasubramania Iyer take his students to the seashore?</strong></p> <p><span>Sivasubramania Iyer takes his students to the seashore because he wanted to demonstrate the mechanism of bird flight to the students.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Critical Thinking</strong></p> <p><strong>a. APJ Abdul Kalam became a renowned aerospace scientist in his later life. Do you find any association of his childhood days in shaping his career? Explain with specific instances from the text.</strong></p> <p>Yes, there is an association between APJ Abdul Kalam's childhood days and his career choice. As a child, Kalam was inspired by his teacher who taught students about how birds fly in an engaging way. The teacher took the students to the beach to demonstrate this. Kalam also enjoyed solving math puzzles in his free time. This early exposure to science and math helped shape his interest in these fields. He then went on to become a renowned aerospace scientist.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Kalam mentions an instance of discrimination against him in his school life. What picture of society does he want to depict by mentioning the incident? Discuss.</strong></p> <p>In the incident Kalam mentioned, one of his school teachers did not like that a Hindu boy and Muslim boy were friends. He stopped them from sitting together. By sharing this, Kalam wants to depict what society was like at that time - there was discrimination between Hindus and Muslims. People of different religions were often not allowed to interact. Only a few teachers, like Kalam's father and the temple priest, did not agree with such separation based on religion. Overall, society viewed Hindus and Muslims as separate groups that should not mix.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Kalam mentions this incident to highlight the religious discrimination that existed in Indian society during his childhood. It shows how divided communities were and how integration was discouraged. Through this anecdote, he aims to convey the prevailing social attitudes of the time towards religious diversity and inclusion.</p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Writing</strong></p> <p><strong>Write a short autobiography featuring your childhood life using the following guidelines.</strong></p> <p>I was born in a small village in Baglung district in Nepal. My earliest memories are of growing up surrounded by nature's beauty in my village. I lived with my parents and younger brother in a small house near agricultural fields.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>My childhood days were simple yet happy. Each morning, my day would start with my mother gently waking me. I would get ready and have a quick breakfast before heading to the local primary school. My teachers were kind and dedicated their time to teaching us basic skills. I specially enjoyed our English lessons where I would listen to stories and poems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>While education was important, childhood is also a time for play. After school, my friends and I would find ways to entertain ourselves. We would play hide and seek in the fields, race each other, and exchange snacks. Simple things brought us a lot of joy.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>On returning home in the evenings, the comforting aroma of a hot meal prepared by my mother would fill our house. It was a time for our family to come together. After dinner, I would do some chores or homework before bed.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Those early years in my village formed the foundation for my character. I am grateful for the loving care of my parents and wonderful childhood memories I have of my community. It was a picture of simplicity, bonding and values that I continue to cherish.</p> <p><br /></p>  <p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p> <p>1.

True or False or NOT GIVEN</strong></p> <p><span>a. The system of QR codes was first launched in South Asia. - &nbsp;False</span></p> <p><span>b. The standards of payments via the QR codes were approved by EMVCo. - False</span></p> <p><span>c. All sorts of businesses are aided by the QR code payments. - Not Given</span></p> <p><span>d.

The QR codes payment service is not applicable to small businesses. - False</span></p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>B. Answer these questions.</strong></p> <p><strong>a. How can one pay with QR codes?</strong></p> <p>To pay with QR codes, one simply needs to scan the merchant's QR code displayed at the store/stall using their mobile banking app. The app will then process the payment by deducting the amount from their bank account once they confirm the transaction.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. How did Tencent and Alibaba companies utilise the QR code services at the beginning?</strong></p> <p>Tencent and Alibaba were early adopters of QR code payments in China. They implemented QR code standards for payments within their hugely popular messaging/mobile platforms WeChat Pay and AliPay respectively. This allowed users to easily make payments scanning codes without the need for cash or cards.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. How do the QR code based payment services launched by Visa and Mastercard mitigate problems?</strong></p> <p>Visa and Mastercard's QR code payment services help address issues like lack of infrastructure e.g. POS machines. They allow making instant, cashless payments directly from bank accounts via a linked debit or credit card, expanding access.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Why do we need a scheme operator to run the QR code based payment system?</strong></p> <p>A scheme operator is needed to govern rules and standards for QR payments, authorize transactions, handle disputes and ensure interoperability between different entities like banks, wallets, merchants etc participating in the system. This helps maintain integrity, security and trust in QR payments.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. What Basic requirements are needed to use the QR codes services?</strong></p> <p>The basic requirements are - a smartphone with an app from a participating bank/payment network and your bank account linked to that app. Many QR payment systems also allow use without needing to register beforehand for added convenience.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. How can security concerns related to payment via QR codes be addressed?</strong></p> <p>Security can be improved by implementing user authentication, tokenization to mask real account details, encryption of data in transit, limiting payment amount without pins/biometrics, and technologies like digital signatures for non-repudiation of transactions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. Who should be more careful: customer or the merchant in terms of payment issues? Why?</strong></p> <p>The customer should exercise more caution since they are initiating the payment and sharing their bank account details. They need to carefully check payment amount and merchant details displayed on their phone match the actual transaction before confirming. This helps prevent errors and fraud.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. Do you think the QR code based payment can be a panacea for all sorts of payment problems? Why?</strong></p> <p>QR code based payments have the potential to address many payment problems due to their convenience. However, for it to be a universal solution, issues like accessibility in remote areas, interoperability between different players, and protecting vulnerable users require continued innovation and regulatory oversight. Adoption also depends on awareness and literacy.</p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>Critical thinking</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Some business houses, shops and department stores in city areas have started to adopt QR code payment systems in Nepal, too. What should be done to make it more accessible? Discuss.</strong></p> <p>Here are some things that could be done to make QR code payments more accessible in Nepal:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Improve internet infrastructure: For QR codes to work smoothly, fast and reliable internet access is critical. Both broadband speed and coverage need expanding nationwide.</p> <p>Increase smartphone penetration: More affordable smartphones will allow greater segments of the population to participate. Manufacturers and telecoms could offer cheaper models.</p> <p>Educate users: Launch awareness drives to educate people, especially in rural areas, on using basic smartphones and QR payment apps. Demonstrate the benefits and convenience.</p> <p>Simplify payment apps: Apps need very intuitive, easy-to-use interfaces that even novice users can understand. Minimum input fields and large targets to scan codes.</p> <p>Interoperability: Payment networks and digital wallets must work together to ensure users can pay any merchant, not just those in their own system.</p> <p>Incentivize merchants: Offer business owners incentives to set up QR infrastructure. Provide affordable POS machines and training on accepting payments.</p> <p>Regulatory support: The central bank and government should support industry efforts through policies, help create standards and audit security regularly.</p> <p>Alternate modes: Provide options like USSD-based payments for feature phones to expand the scope beyond smartphones.</p> <p>Widespread adoption will take time but focusing on infrastructure development, education, simplification and cooperation between stakeholders can accelerate Nepal's QR payment ecosystem.</p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>b. Is it possible to apply such cashless methods in payments in Nepal? Discuss.</strong></p> <p><span>The literacy rate of Nepal is about 65% as per the census report of 2068 BS. It implies almost 1 third of the total population does not even have got the basic education. How can we imagine Nepal being dependent on cashless Payment methods then?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p>However, it is not hard to make payment methods digital and introduce cashless options in Nepal because the use of cash for payments is quickly being replaced by digital methods. To help Nepal's digital economy grow, QR code payments could be very important.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The main way to encourage people to use these payment methods is by teaching them how to use them. Once people are taught, they can get used to it even if they are not literate. However, many people still lack the necessary skills to handle digital payments properly, which can lead to data breaches and privacy issues, making it more complicated.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>It is possible to use digital payment systems in Nepal if the lack of these facilities is addressed. To use cashless payment methods, people need a smartphone and technical knowledge, which should be accessible to everyone, including proper guidance on how to handle them securely.<span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Writing</span></p> <p><strong>B. Write a news article about digital payment systems in Nepal.</strong></p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p>Nepal Embraces Digital Payments</p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>By Shivahari Poudel&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Kathmandu, Nepal - Digital payment systems are gaining widespread adoption across Nepal, providing many residents with a more convenient way to pay for goods and services. Industry leaders say the future of payments is moving away from cash transactions and toward platforms that enable contactless and remote payments.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\"We are seeing tremendous growth in the use of digital wallets, bank transfers, and mobile payment apps in recent years,\" said Samir Shrestha of Khalti, one of Nepal's largest digital payment platforms. \"More Nepali consumers and businesses now have the option to pay and receive payments digitally without having to handle cash.\"</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Common digital payment methods in Nepal include mobile wallets like Khalti and eSewa, which allow users to deposit and store funds that can then be used to pay merchants online or in stores using a mobile app. Bank transfers through systems like FonePay and IME Pay enable customers to send and receive payments directly from their bank accounts. There has also been rising interest in payment tools that integrate with popular social media and messaging platforms.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift away from cash as health experts recommended contactless transactions. With ongoing concerns about virus transmission through banknotes and coins, digital payments provided a safer alternative for day-to-day purchases. Major retailers and service providers started promoting \"Tap and Pay\" options using digital wallets and debit/credit cards fitted with NFC chips.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Analysts say strong support from the government helped digital finance thrive in Nepal. Regulators have instituted consumer protections for digital payments while incentivizing widespread adoption through partnerships with banks, telecom firms, and startups. International remittances, a major source of funds flowing into Nepal, can now be more cheaply and easily sent via digital channels.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As technology access and literacy increases across both urban and rural Nepal, experts forecast further growth of digital payment volumes in the coming years. The convenience, safety, and financial inclusion benefits of leaving cash behind appear to be driving more Nepalis toward a cashless future.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Grammar</strong></p> <p><strong>A.

"reward": "<p>Project Work</p> <p><strong>Browse the internet. Find out the history of money and read. Write some interesting facts about money and tell your class.</strong></p> <p>Good morning class. Today I want to share some interesting facts about the history of money.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Money as we know it today has been evolving for thousands of years. Some of the earliest forms of money were commodity currencies, where commodities like cattle, grains, or shells served as a medium of exchange. For example, cowry shells were used as currency in Africa as early as 3000 BC.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Coins were first invented in Lydia in what is now modern Turkey around 600 BC. The coins were made from electrum, a naturally occurring pale yellow alloy of gold and silver. This was one of the earliest uses of coins as currency.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Around 600-500 BC, coins began spreading to other Mediterranean civilizations like Greece and Persia. The ancient Greeks were the first to mint pure silver coins around 650-600 BC in Aegina and Athens. These silver coins helped facilitate trade throughout Greece and beyond.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In Imperial China, paper money was first used as early as the 9th century during the Tang Dynasty. Unfortunately many of these early notes were just paper receipts and not backed by currency reserves. This led to episodes of hyperinflation. It wasn't until the Ming Dynasty in the 14th century that true paper money backed by coinage became widely used.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>One of the most revolutionary developments was when gold and silver standards were adopted by many economies. This started in Europe during the late Middle Ages and tied currency values to precious metals like gold and silver. The gold standard dominated the international monetary system from 1875 to 1914 prior to the First World War.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Today most of the world uses fiat currency which is not backed by any commodities, but instead holds value through regulation by central banks and faith in the government. Paper money, coins, and more recently digital currencies like bitcoin continue to evolve the way we exchange value in modern societies.</p> <p><br /></p> "

Complete the following sentences with words/ phrases from the text.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>a. According to Sophie Scott, laughter is one of the most important and misunderstood behaviours.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>b. After her study in Namibia, Scott came to the realization that laughter is one of our richest vocal tics.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>c. Studies have shown that there are six universal expressions across cultures based on facial expressions.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>d. Scott found out that most of the laughs have nothing to do with humour.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>e.

Answer the following questions.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Why do people giggle at someone’s pain or suffering?</strong></p> <p>People often giggle at someone's pain or suffering because laughter can be a social response, serving to relieve tension in uncomfortable or awkward situations. It's not necessarily a malicious reaction, but rather a way to cope with the discomfort of seeing someone in pain.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. What did Scott’s study in Namibia come up with?</strong></p> <p>Scott's study in Namibia found that laughter is one of the most easily recognizable emotions across different cultures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. How is laughter a social bonding?</strong></p> <p>Laughter is a social bonding tool because it signals to others that you like them, agree with them, or feel part of the same group. Laughing together with someone strengthens relationships and helps people bond, even when there's no humor involved.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. According to the author, what role does laughter play in husband-wife relationship?</strong></p> <p>According to the author, couples who laugh together find it easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event, and they are likely to stay together for longer.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. How does laughter work as a painkiller?</strong></p> <p>Laughter can work as a painkiller by encouraging the release of endorphins, which are natural chemicals that promote feelings of pleasure and reduce pain perception.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. What did the study find about the relation between laughter and brain?</strong></p> <p>The study found that both authentic and more artificial laughs activate the brain's mirror regions, which are responsible for mimicking others' actions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. What are two emotions that the author associates with infants and adults?</strong></p> <p>The author associates crying with infants as their primary way of communicating, while laughter gains more importance as people get older.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. How does a stand-up comedian take the audience’s laughter?</strong></p> <p>Stand-up comedians often find it easier to work in large venues because laughter is contagious.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>i. Show the relation between laughter and crowd.</strong></p> <p>The relation between laughter and a crowd is that laughter can spread quickly within a group.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>j. What does the author mean when he says “there is always a meaning to it?”</strong></p> <p>When the author says, there is always a meaning to it, they mean that laughter is never neutral. It always serves a purpose.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>CRITICAL THINKING&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Do you agree that the couples, who laugh together, stay together?'Is it important for married couples to have the same sense of humour? Why?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Yes, it is important for married couples to have the same sense of humor. Couples who can laugh together are more likely to stay together. When couples enjoy each other's company and support each other's opinions, it helps them maintain a close connection. Laughing together also encourages couples to share personal information and build a strong bond. Laughing can also help couples cope with stress and strengthen their friendship.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Some people believe that sometimes crying is good for health. Do you believe it? Give your reasons.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Yes, I believe that crying can sometimes be good for your health. Here are two reasons why:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>It reduces stress. Crying helps remove stress hormones and other chemicals from the body that build up when we're feeling anxious or tense.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>It makes us feel better emotionally. When people cry, they often feel less anxious or worried after. Crying can help release inner feelings and return to a normal mood.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>WRITING&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>A. Write a paragraph narrating an event from your life when you were involved in contagious laughter.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>One time when I was in college, I was with a group of my friends visiting the local temple on a weekend. My friend Hari was leading the group and trying to keep us all together. However, our other friend Ram was lagging behind the group and taking his time. To tease Ram, Hari jokingly said 'Come on Ram, you're walking as slow as a tortoise!' When I heard Hari's comment, I let out a little laugh. Hearing me laugh then caused my other friends to start laughing too. Soon we were all standing there laughing loudly at Hari's joke about Ram. Even Ram himself started laughing with us. It was one of those moments where someone's laughter caused everyone else to also start laughing uncontrollably. Just remembering that moment still makes me smile and chuckle to this day.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>B. Write a description of your favourite comedian explaining his/her personality, acting, performance and uniqueness.</strong></p> <p>One comedian I really enjoy is Kedar Ghimire. He has such a lively, energetic personality that really shines through in his comedy performances. Kedar is able to connect with audiences by sharing funny stories and observations about everyday life experiences. As an actor, he often plays roles as the energetic person who isn't afraid to speak his mind. In his plays and TV roles, Kedar has great timing and delivery with his jokes. He's also very animated with his body language and facial expressions. Even though he jokes about difficult topics like relationships or family, he does so in a lighthearted way that makes people laugh. What makes Kedar truly unique is that he combines humor with some inspirational messages about working hard and following your dreams. Overall, his high-energy style of comedy never fails to put a smile on my face.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Grammar</strong></p> <p><strong>B.

How does the author describe the Japanese waste management system?</strong></p> <p><span>Ans: The Author describes the Japanese waste management system as an organized, unique and sarcastic system all at once. There existed such a system where the trash was used to be cleaned up at a specific time at a specific place. He calls it awkward to learn their habit of not using anything second hand material, no matter if it is a car or an expensive TV set. He calls it sarcastic because people who were too shy and spirited at day time not using second hand items were also picking up things at night.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>B. What are the two reasons behind the existence of Sodaigomi in Japanese culture?</strong></p> <p><span>Ans: The two factors behind the existence of Sodaigomi in Japanese culture were the absence of a basement, garage or extra room in the tiny Japanese home and the Japanese love for cleanliness.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>C. What, according to the author, do the Japanese feel at the thought of buying second-hand items?</strong></p> <p><span>Ans: Japanese feel like buying second hand items as buying someone’s socks. It means they feel very timid and uncivilized to use second hand items.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>D. How is Malaysian culture different from Japanese culture concerning the used items?</strong></p> <p><span>Ans:&nbsp;</span>In Malaysia, people believe in utilizing everything and rarely throw anything away. Even expensive items are valued and not easily discarded. Malaysians enthusiastically bid on second-hand items in auctions. On the other hand, in Japan, even expensive items are often thrown away, and second-hand items are looked down upon, similar to used socks.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>E. Why did the author feel awkward at the sodaigomi pile?</strong></p> <p><span>Ans:&nbsp;</span>The author felt awkward at the sodaigomi pile because he wanted to take things he needed, but it went against the typical Japanese culture of not using second-hand items. This made him feel uncomfortable.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>F. How many articles did the author bring to his house one after another?</strong></p> <p><span>Ans:&nbsp;</span>The author brought several items to his house, including tea, an expensive chair, a new bicycle bell, a small wooden cabinet, a complete set of wrenches and screwdrivers in a metal toolbox, a Naugahyde-covered barstool, a lacquer serving tray, bookshelves, televisions, and more.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>G. Why do most people try to find things in the trash pile ‘in the dead of the night’?</strong></p> <p><span>Ans: &nbsp;Most people try to find things in the trash in the dead of the night because not everyone can afford to always use first and fresh items. Another reason was, that was the time when people had no shame or mocking at picking up things that were needed.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>H. How did the author’s family assimilate Japanese culture in using consumer goods?</strong></p> <p><span>Ans: Assimilate means to digest or to be habitual with. The Author’s family assimilated with Japanese Culture in using consumer goods by picking up things at night and being luxurious in day time, like the Japanese did. Consumed goods are not used by the majority of Japanese citizens. But, some used to pick up trash at night because they are not supervised.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <h1 style=\"font-size: 2em;\"><span>Critical thinking&nbsp;</span></h1> <p><strong>a. If you happen to be in Japan someday, will you collect articles from sodaigomi? Why or why not?</strong></p> <p><span>Ans: It depends upon the situation. If I happen to be in Japan someday, I will surely collect articles from sodaigomi if I have no or average financial strength. For various reasons (education, job, etc.), many citizens from Nepal move to Japan. Money management is a problem for them. To save money, I will probably utilize second-hand products, since they have a lot of essentials. In order to avoid detection, I may collect them without anybody noticing. Using an used item is not a sin in my culture. &nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. There are some second hand shops in Nepal, too. But, people are not much interested in them. What practice would be suitable in managing second hand items in Nepal?</strong></p> <p><span>Ans:&nbsp;</span>There are several reasons why people in Nepal are hesitant to buy from second-hand shops. Firstly, there is a sense of shame associated with purchasing used items. People fear judgment from others when they are seen buying second-hand products. Additionally, sellers at these shops are often unreliable and make false promises about the quality and durability of the items they sell.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>To effectively manage second-hand items in Nepal, we should normalize the practice of buying used goods. We should not feel ashamed or embarrassed about using these products. While it's important to avoid purchasing items that are in poor condition, we can confidently buy second-hand furniture, electrical equipment, and cars that are in good shape. By changing our attitudes and shopping habits, we can embrace the value and benefits of second-hand items.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Writing</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Write a paragraph focusing on the concept of waste management using the 3rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle).</strong></p> <p>The 3Rs approach of reduce, reuse and recycle provides an effective strategy for waste management and environmental protection. Reducing the amount of waste generated in the first place is the most important of the 3Rs. This can be done by choosing products with less packaging, avoiding single-use items, and reducing consumption in general. For items that can no longer be used for their original purpose, reusing them wherever possible extends their lifespan and keeps useful materials out of landfills. Examples include reusing plastic bags, glass jars, clothing, and electronics. Finally, ensuring items are recycled at the end of their useful life is crucial. Recycling recovers materials and transforms waste into new products or raw materials. If everyone were to consistently apply the 3Rs in their daily lives and industries optimized waste reduction, the quantity of trash ending up in landfills or polluting the environment could be significantly decreased. This sustainable approach benefits both the environment and the health of communities.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. In most of Nepal's cities, waste management is a major issue. Write a letter to the editor to be published in the daily newspaper suggesting ways of ‘Solving Garbage Problems.’</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span>Tinkune-5, Kathmandu</span></p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span>16, November 2021</span></p> <p><span>To the editor,</span></p> <p><span>Himalayan Daily,</span></p> <p><span>Kathmandu, Nepal</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span>Subject: To publish my article on garbage management in Nepal.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Dear Sir,</span></p> <p><span>It’s not necessary to remind you that the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, has been plagued by waste for the last 20 years, but now the whole country is affected. Not only the city inhabitants but also the foreigners and tourists have an unfavorable impression of our city because it is littered with waste. I'll go through some of the best strategies to avoid the issue of garbage here. I'd appreciate it if you published my article on Garbage management, which is a major issue in most of Nepal's major cities.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Garbage has many sources, in which household, industries, hospitals, vehicles are the major. First, we should separate the garbage on the basis of its nature. If it is organic, we can use it to make manures and if it is inorganic, we could either use the 3RS method, or simply use the incineration method, which will cause less smoke to burn down the trash.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>First idea is compost manure preparation:</strong></p> <p><span>Biodegradable trash may be used to provide economic advantages. Composting or vermin composting may be used to turn organic waste into compost from solid waste or rubbish. Rural farmers have long used compost to generate manure. Being farmers, we should prioritize compost manure over inorganic fertilizers.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Second option is to use landfill.</strong></p> <p><span>In landfills, garbage is buried beneath the surface of the ground. &nbsp;Pits or man-made pits are often utilized for landfilling. A well-managed landfill may be both sanitary and cost-effective for disposing of waste.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Third method is to utilize the usable trash</strong></p> <p><span>Electricity and heat could be produced by the waste. Both the production of more energy from rubbish waste and the reduction of Nepal's garbage waste issue are enhanced as a result of this approach.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Fourth option is incineration</strong></p> <p><span>An incinerator is a device that burns rubbish and other solid organic waste with less smoke production.

In the clothing section, he found some brand new branded shirts with tags still attached at a fraction of the original price. John was surprised by the variety of goods on offer - there were sections for books, home decor, electronics and even some vintage furniture pieces. He ended up purchasing a pair of leather shoes and a few books. John said visiting the second-hand shop allowed him to satisfy his curiosity while being environmentally conscious and saving money.

The author of the text above has the opinion that Julia Hill made her pastime in a tree for two years more.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>b. The sentence ‘Julia had occasional visitors’ indicates she had a few visitors now and then.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>C. The logging company managed 24 hour security service around the tree to discourage her from her campaign.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>D. Ms. Hill began to respond to the loggers with songs and conventional conversations because she had unconditional love for all nature’s creations.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>E. Julia Hill climbed down the tree after 738 days when her demands were about to be fulfilled.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>B. Answer the following questions.</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Who was Julia Butterfly Hill? How did Hill’s campaign gain popularity?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Julia Butterfly Hill was an American activist. Hill's campaign became very popular because she lived in a very tall redwood tree for over 2 years to protest against cutting down the forest.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. What made Hill start her mega campaign to save redwood trees?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Hill started her big campaign to save redwood trees because all the redwood trees in California were being cut down cruelly.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. What kinds of amenities were there to support Hill’s life in the tree?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Hill had only basic things like a sleeping bag, a mobile phone that could be charged with solar power, and a gas stove to cook and boil water to survive in the tree.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Did Hill's value of life change after her car accident? How?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Yes, Hill's thoughts about life changed after her accident. The accident made her think carefully about protecting the redwood forest. She started focusing more on important things like helping others, not on money or what others think.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. Deforestation causes natural calamities. What evidence do you have in the text to prove this?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>The text says that without trees on a slope in California, heavy rain caused a big mudslide that destroyed many trees and left 7 people homeless. This shows deforestation can cause disasters.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. How did the logging company try to discourage Hill in the early days of her sit-in?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>The logging company tried many ways to make Hill leave. They put guards to stop her friends from giving her food. A helicopter flew close to scare her. They cut down a nearby tree and hurt Luna. They also threatened her with violence, rape and death. Bright lights and loud noises tortured her at night.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g.How were the vagaries of nature unwelcoming to Hill?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Nature was also very hard on Hill. In a big storm with very strong winds, her shelter was destroyed and big branches fell off the tree. Snow and lightning tore her roof and walls. Her feet got very cold and covered in blisters from frostbite.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h.What is the purpose of the author to write a review on Hill’s book? Do you think the author stands for ecological sustainability? Give reasons.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>The author wrote a review of Hill's book to raise awareness about the problems of cutting down forests. Yes, by choosing to write about Hill's work protecting trees, the author supports taking care of the environment.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Critical thinking&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Suppose you are Julia Butterfly Hill. After staying one year in the tree, the government offered you five million dollars and requested you to drop the strike. Write in about 200 words responding to them that the money is a mean thing for you in comparison with the woods.</strong></p> <p>I appreciate your offer to end my sit-in for 5 million dollars. However, money means little to me compared to protecting these magnificent redwood trees. I have endured over a year of difficult conditions in Luna to save her from being cut down. I have faced threats, harassment and the harsh forces of nature. Yet none of these hardships mattered as much to me as seeing this beautiful old-growth tree standing tall.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>I did not take up residence in Luna for personal gain or recognition. My goal has always been to draw attention to the plight of the redwood forests and stop their senseless destruction. Clear cutting these ecologically important trees must end in order to protect the environment and wildlife. Offering me money ignores the real issue confronting the woods I care so deeply about.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As long as logging continues, my protest will continue as well. No amount of money can replace what has already been lost or undo the damage done. I ask that you use the $5 million for conservation instead, such as purchasing threatened redwood lands or replanting cut areas. The only way to satisfy my campaign is through lasting protection of the forest, not temporary relief paid to one person. I will not abandon my cause or Luna for financial gain. The redwoods are worth far more than any sum of money.</p> <p><br /></p> <h1 style=\"font-size: 2em;\"><span>Writing &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></h1> <p><strong>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;Write a review of a book/film which you have read/watched recently.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>A review of the movie: Pashupati Prasad</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Director: Dependra K. Khanal</span></p> <p><span>Starring: Khagendra Lamichane, Rabindra Singh Baniya, Bipin Karki, and Barsha Shiwakoti</span></p> <p><span>Producers: Rojina Staula</span></p> <p><span>Genre: Social</span></p> <p><span>Duration: 130 minutes</span></p> <p><span>Language: Nepali</span></p> <p><span>Released date: January 29, 2016</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Pashupati Prasad's narrative was written by Dependra K. Khanal. Pashupati Prasad's struggle is well shown in the film. It has shown the hardships of a common poor Nepali Youth who dreams of having a good life but is hindered by poverty. At last, a very unexpected twist happens in the movie. You should watch it once to know what happened.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Pashupati (Khagendra Lamichhane) moves to Kathmandu after the huge Baisakh earthquake, which causes him to lose his family and his home in Sindhupalchowk. He has no property but he has fifty thousand dollars in debts from his father, who died in the earthquake. In Pashupatinath, he lives with Mitt Buwa, who goes through the dead bodies and collects the coins. He also goes to search for gold in the Bagmati River. He spends his time with a Hanuman (a criminal who changed his appearance to bypass the police). There is a conflict when Bhasme (Bipin Karki) tries to halt Pashupati's efforts. He also falls in love with a Mute girl (Barsha Shiwakoti) while selling second hand sarees in the street. He collects money to buy a Momo’s cart. One day Pashupati finds a gold ring in Bagmati River and goes to sell it. But, the jeweler misuses his ignorance and calls the public blaming him that he stole his ring. The public beats him until he dies.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>There will be tears in your eyes as you finish watching this heartbreaking movie. You will be able to see yourself in the protagonist's hardships. He does all he can to make a few dollars, but he fails. Moreover, how stunning the cinematography in this film is. Artists and actors that use dramatic tones in their performances, in my opinion, touch the hearts of everyone in the theater. He is a natural performer, and his performance and part in the film are captivating.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>I think this is a really good film. Don’t miss it.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>B. Your school is going to organize a speech competition on Friday. The subject of the speech is “Let’s save the trees and protect our environment.” Draft a speech using the following prompts.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Greetings to the intellectuals, notable guests, my revered teachers, and my beloved friends this morning. My speech's title is 'Let's save the trees and protect our environment.' Through my speech, I want to convey to you the importance of trees and forests, as well as their contribution to our lives.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Plants, and animals make up the natural world. Millions of trees and billions of live creatures exist in this environment. The whole atmosphere, soil, plants, water are equally needed by human beings and all other species and they may coexist only in a healthy environment.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Trees are one of the most vital natural resources that sustain all life on Earth. Trees help protect the natural environment by controlling pollution levels and removing toxic air from the atmosphere generated by human activities. They provide a safe haven for a large number of animals and aid in the natural process of enhancing soil fertility.</span></p> <p><span>As a thank you for all of the advantages trees bring, we selfishly take them down. We are so reliant on this natural resource that we are destroying it and causing damage to the environment in the process. There will be no place left to live on this planet if this trend of deforestation continues and people don't grasp the need of planting trees.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Trees save us. So, we should start saving ourselves by planting trees in our own backyard and throughout our community. We should spread the word about the necessity of doing so. For the sake of the environment and the rest of the world, we have to do what we can without the greed of recognition.</span></p> <p><span>At last, Let's all agree to abandon this destructive practice and instead focus on reforestation. Let’s pledge to rescue the trees and save the world!</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Thank you!</span></p> <p><br /></p> <h1 style=\"font-size: 2em; text-align: justify;\"><span>Grammar &nbsp;</span></h1> <p><strong>Reported speech</strong></p> <p><strong>B.

What does a cV mean and why is it important in one's career?</strong></p> <p>A cV means \"course of life\". It is a record of your professional and personal achievements and information. It is important for one's career because employers use it to decide if they should hire you, give you a promotion or provide research funding.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Does the same CV work for all job opportunities? Why or why not?</strong></p> <p>The same CV may be used for different jobs but it is better to make small changes to the CV based on the job description. This helps show the skills and experience most related to that particular job.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. What are the different areas where CV can help you?</strong></p> <p>A CV can help you in different areas like getting a job, promotion or research funding. Organizations also use your CV to understand your qualifications and accomplishments when deciding if you are suitable for something.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. What do you mean by 'staying CV' and 'leaving CV'? Which one would you develop for yourself as a freshman?</strong></p> <p>A 'staying CV' focuses more on committee work and administration experience while a 'leaving CV' highlights your research achievements and overall competence. As a freshman, I would create a 'leaving CV' to showcase my abilities and willingness to perform different academic tasks.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. How can you draft a good CV?</strong></p> <p>To draft a good CV, I will organize all necessary information well and write it clearly in the proper format. I will also get ideas from experienced people to make my CV quality.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. What is the difference between academic CV and non-academic CV?</strong></p> <p>Academic CVs are usually longer than non-academic CVs. They become more detailed over time. Non-academic CVs often just describe skills and qualities but academic CVs provide verifiable proofs of accomplishments and achievements.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Critical thinking</strong></p> <p><strong>a. CV may not represent a person’s skills and abilities accurately because one’s confidence cannot be rendered in a paper. What do you think employers should do to find the best people for the job?</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While a CV shows qualifications and experience, it doesn't show how confident someone is. To find the best people, employers should also conduct interviews to directly assess candidates' skills, personality and fit for the role. This allows employers to learn more about the person beyond what's on paper and help identify those with the right qualifications and personality for the job.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. If the employers provide job opportunities by assessing one’s CV, how can fresh graduates compete with the experienced competitors?</strong></p> <p>To compete with experienced people when companies look at resumes, fresh graduates can do several things to make their resumes stand out. They should focus on discussing their recent education in school, mentioning classes that are relevant to the job. It's also important to include any internships, part-time work, or class projects that can demonstrate real experience. Fresh graduates should pick and highlight the skills, certificates, and training that are most useful for the position. They need to customize their resume for each job by changing it to match what the company is asking for in the job description. They can describe their work and successes using strong verbs to make it more engaging. Where possible, they should add numbers or percentages to showcase what they achieved quantitatively. Soft skills like adapting, communicating, and working in a team, which are valuable for any job, should also be mentioned. Networking through events, LinkedIn, and job groups can help make new connections. Asking teachers, past bosses or mentors for referrals or recommendations for companies. Finally, showing a commitment to continuous learning and improving one's skills on an ongoing basis. By focusing on these areas, fresh graduates can make their resumes competitive against candidates with more work experience when applying for jobs.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Writing</strong></p> <p><strong>A.

What is the author’s favourite hobby?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>The author's favorite hobby is walking. She likes it because it provides a physical sensation she enjoys, the movement, rhythm, and undulation of the senses and body.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. What sorts of roads did the writer prefer to walk on when she was very young?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>When the writer was very young, she preferred to walk on unpaved and uneven roads, like the paths around her mamaghar.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. How did walking give the author and her classmates a sense of freedom?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Walking gave the author and her classmates a sense of freedom because they took shortcuts and chose their own way during their walks home from school, which felt like a protest against their regimented routine.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. In what ways were the roads in Kathmandu different from the ones in Sydney?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>The roads in Kathmandu were unpaved and uneven, while in Sydney, they were quieter, more organized, and had both old and new elements.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. How did walking help the author in the new country?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Walking helped the author in the new country (Australia) by allowing her to explore and navigate her surroundings, helping her find her way in a new place.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. What were the treasures of Petersham, where the writer lived with her family?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>The treasures of Petersham, where the writer lived with her family, included a tiny park and another park with a huge rock, providing a buffer zone and a place to hide.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. What things became her permanent friends with whom she could share her feelings?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>The earth and the sky, the trees, water, and the physical and natural world became the author's permanent friends with whom she could share her feelings during her solitary walks.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. Why did she feel that she had travelled to ‘a desert, to emptiness’ as she went to the United States?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>The author felt that she had traveled to 'a desert, to emptiness' in the United States because her experiences were new and unexpected, making her feel alone and in search of grounding.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>i. Why did the author eventually feel that the strange city was known to her?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Even though the city was strange to her, the author felt that the place itself was known to her, and she sensed the spirits of those who had lived there before.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>j. How did walking make her feel at home with different places she visited?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Walking made the author feel at home with different places she visited because it allowed her to connect with the natural and physical world, reminding her of her intrinsic self regardless of where she was.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>CRITICAL THINKING&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>a. Do you believe that walking helps us understand ourselves? Give reasons in support of your opinion.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Yes, I believe that walking helps us understand ourselves better for a few reasons:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Walking allows time for reflection. When we walk, particularly alone, it gives our minds a chance to wander and think without many external distractions. This reflection time can provide insight into who we are, what we value, and how we view the world.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>It promotes mindfulness of our body and surroundings. The rhythmic physical activity of walking combined with being outdoors makes us more attuned to bodily sensations and the natural environment. This mindfulness can translate to greater self-awareness.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>It fosters connection to place. By walking the same paths over time, we start to feel more grounded and \"at home\" wherever we are, whether familiar or new surroundings. This sense of connection and comfort with place may mirror how we learn to feel more connected and comfortable with ourselves.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Think of one of your hobbies. How does this hobby relate to your psyche and self?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>I enjoy practicing yoga as one of my hobbies. It is connected to my mind and self because it allows me to relax while still being productive. Doing yoga makes me look and feel better physically while also reducing stress levels.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Yoga is beneficial for reducing stress and anxiety and can help when coping with depression. It gives me an opportunity for self-improvement. Yoga is good for developing one's personality as it makes us mentally stronger and more self-sufficient by overcoming obstacles in life and enhancing our inner creativity and hidden talents.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Yoga is an excellent way to unwind spiritually and mentally, as well as to enhance both physical and mental health. It can help prevent high blood pressure and improves overall wellness. The relaxing practices help clear the mind while also strengthening the body. Regular yoga sessions provide holistic benefits to both mental and physical health.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Many people turn their hobbies into careers. Is it good to turn one's hobby into a career?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Turning a hobby into a career can be a great idea, but it's not always the best choice for everyone. Here are some simple explanations of the pros and cons:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Good things about turning a hobby into a career:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Passion: If you love what you do, working on your hobby can be very enjoyable and fulfilling.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Motivation: You might be more motivated to work hard and improve because you genuinely enjoy it.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Creative Freedom: Turning your hobby into a job can give you more control and freedom in how you work.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Potential Income: If your hobby is in demand, it can potentially make you money.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Bad things:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Pressure: When your hobby becomes a job, there can be more pressure to perform, which might take away some of the fun.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Financial Risk: Not all hobbies make good careers, so there's a risk of financial instability.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Burnout: Doing something you love too much can sometimes lead to burnout, where you get tired of it.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Uncertainty: Turning a hobby into a job might change your relationship with it, and you might lose the joy you once had.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In the end, it depends on your unique situation and how much you're willing to take on the challenges that come with turning a hobby into a career. Some people find it incredibly rewarding, while others prefer to keep their hobbies separate from their work.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Writing</p> <p><strong>Highlighting the advantages of walking, Henry David Thoreau says, “An early- morning walk is a blessing for the whole day.” Write an essay on the advantages of morning walk.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Title : The Advantages of Morning Walk</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Thoreau was right when he said that an early-morning walk is a blessing for the whole day. Taking a walk in the morning has considerable physical, mental and emotional benefits. He understood intuitively what modern science has proven - that morning physical activity can drastically improve both health and productivity.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>One of the major advantages of a morning walk is that it helps to energize the body. When we wake up, our bodies are still sluggish from sleep. Going for a walk gets the blood circulating and releases endorphins that boost energy levels. The increased oxygen flow reinvigorates muscles and organs. This leaves us feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day ahead. Morning walkers report feeling more alert and less tired throughout the day compared to those who skip their walks.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In addition to physical energy, a morning walk also provides mental clarity. Light exercise has been shown to increase blood flow to the brain. This enhances cognition and focus. Scientific studies have found correlations between regular morning exercise and improved memory, problem-solving skills and mood. While going for a walk, we are also exposed to sunlight which aids in regulating circadian rhythms and serotonin production. This positively impacts our mental well-being.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Emotional wellness is another benefit. Spending time in nature has calming and stress-reducing effects. The solitude of a morning walk allows us to clear our minds of worries and mentally prepare for the day. Low impact activities like walking simultaneously boost endorphins and diminish stress hormones like cortisol. Over time, morning walkers report feeling more positive, relaxed and emotionally balanced compared to non-walkers. This improved mood carries over throughout the day and we are able to face challenges with renewed optimism.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In summary, a daily morning walk offers considerable physical, mental and emotional advantages that enrich both health and productivity. By dedicating just 30 minutes to soak in the early light and fresh air, we are rewarded with renewed energy, focus, well-being and clarity of thought to handle our daily lives. Thoreau was truly perceptive in recognizing walking's ability to bless the entirety of one's day.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Grammar</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b.

During the interview, try to explore how these hobbies can have impacts on their everyday life and career. Prepare a report including their responses and your opinions.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Hobbies Interview Report</p> <p><br /></p> <p>I interviewed three of my classmates - John, Lisa and Sarah - about their hobbies and how it impacts their lives.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>John enjoys playing basketball. He said it keeps him active and fit. As an accountant, he sits at a desk all day so basketball is a good way to unwind and de-stress from work. He believes the teamwork aspect also complements his career where he collaborates closely with colleagues.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Lisa's hobby is sketching and watercolor painting. She finds it relaxing and a creative outlet. As a graphic designer, her artistic skills have certainly benefited from this hobby. She has even converted some of her drawings into designs for clients. Her artwork also helps promote her business on social media.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Sarah is passionate about gardening. She grows a variety of fruits, vegetables and flowers. Gardening gives her a sense of satisfaction seeing her plants grow. As an environmental engineer, she sees connections between nurturing nature and her career goals of sustainability. Her hobby has also sparked new ideas for green initiatives at work.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In conclusion, hobbies can enrich our lives in many ways beyond leisure. They offer stress relief from busy schedules and even augment careers through unique skill development. My classmates exemplify how their interests complement and motivate them in their professional lives too.

What are the indicators of the fact that we are very self-conscious about ourselves these days?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>If you read magazines and books, they teach us things like knowing ourselves better, being happy with who we are, and understanding how we think and feel. This shows that we think a lot about ourselves now.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. How have we celebrated the fact that we have our individual identity?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>We have given ourselves real names to show who we are as individuals.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Are we, human beings, really unique? Why/Why not?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>No, there isn't anything that makes humans truly special. We all have the same body parts and structures and follow the same natural rules.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. How do fish recognize each other?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Fish recognize each other by their own unique smells.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>E. What is the function of individuality?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Individuality helps us survive and keep our own identity.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f.

What does the author illustrate with the tale of the nudibranch and the medusa?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>The story shows how important it is to live together in harmony and help each other to survive.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. Why is the author disturbed by the thought of the creatures like the nudibranch and medusa?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>The nudibranchs and medusas make the author feel strange, like in a dream.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>i. What does the writer mean by “they remind me of the whole earth at once?'</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>The phrase means it's very hard to understand and explain the connections between all living and non-living things on Earth. Thinking about it makes a person more confused.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>CRITICAL THINKING</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>a. How does the author make satire on the modern idea of the 'self' based on individuality, independence and uniqueness?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>In this article, Lewis Thomas' \"Medusa and the Snail\" mocks our contemporary concept of \"self,\" which emphasizes the importance of being one's own person, having one's own identity, and being distinct from others.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Once an adult jellyfish swallows a small freshly born slug, the slug slowly eats away at the jellyfish until the jellyfish is reduced to a spherical parasite attached to the snail's skin near its mouth and eventually eaten away completely. It is finally eaten until it is reduced in size and the jellyfish is depleted of its essence, which causes the snail to expand.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>This narrative demonstrates that both species are unable to survive on their own, and must rely on one other for existence. Using the story of the nudibranch and the medusa, the author demonstrates the importance of living in harmony with one another and working together.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Friendship and reliance on one other for life and existence are also shown in the tale. In this way, the author argues that current pride in one's own distinctiveness, liberty, and originality isn't grounded in reality.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Analyze the essay as a creative defense of the interdependence observed in the ecosystem.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>The Medusa and the Snail by Lewis Thomas is a creative way to show how ecological interdependence works. The jellyfish and snail in the Bay of Naples are linked by their need for each other to live and stay alive. This shows how intertwined the environment is.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>In this essay, we saw two species in the Bay of Naples that are very close to each other. Their dependence on each other not only explains why they live, but also how the ecosystem can stay balanced.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>There are a lot of different ways humans and animals connect to each other, as well as how they get along with each other and the rules of their community. As well, it makes people realize that they're not the only ones who want to improve their mental and emotional health.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>When people work together on a project, they build a sense of community and belonging. This is true both on a personal and a social level. It also says that ecosystems are very important for the protection and preservation of living and non-living things or animals, as well as plants.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>WRITING</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>a. Write a 250-word essay on 'Independence vs. Interdependence'&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>An Essay on Individualism vs. Socialism&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>There are usually two ways that people think about themselves and their relationships with other people. To begin with, an individual's perception of his or her existence is that he or she exists independently of others is known as the autonomous self-concept. Interdependent self-concept is characterized by a person's sense of belonging to a larger community. Both the notions of independence and dependency have advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Interdependence self-concept is based on the idea that people in a community rely on each other for existence and growth. To further implant the concept that mental growth and development is not a solitary endeavor, it provides social support for one another's progress as well. Responsibility for sharing is promoted by encouraging people to assume diverse responsibilities that contribute to society's progress and development. Fear may be overcome if you have a strong sense of self-reliance.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>In addition, it fosters a sense of community and a sense of belonging among those involved, whether on a personal or professional level. Independent self-concept is concerned with what makes a person stand apart from the rest of society in terms of his or her internal traits. Because of this, one feels better about himself or herself, which makes it easier on family, friends, and the rest of society. More so, if independence is a goal, it boosts one's self-worth and self-esteem.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Individualism increases one's self-confidence, but interdependence focuses on how individuals interact with one other and how society's current rules govern how people interact. As a whole, society and the country benefit much from both Dependency: To acquire what one desires, one is reliant on the efforts of others. in the person of (you) As a result of one's own hard work, one is able to achieve one's goals.

Write a newspaper article highlighting the increasing individualism in the modern Nepali society.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Modern Nepalese society is becoming more individualistic. Individualism is defined as the power we have as individuals to do what we want, when we want. We would have a more cohesive society if everyone was free to follow their own ambitions. Individualism is becoming more prevalent in Nepalese culture.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Individualism places a high value on self-determination and self-actualization. A culture of individualism places a high value on the accomplishments of those who have made a significant contribution to society.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Nepalese culture now places a high priority on individualism. However, it should be construed positively rather than negatively. Individualism has certain advantages, including the ability to make one's own decisions. Male or female, a number of groups are attempting to provide every citizen their own unique identity.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Support for gender equality in the workplace, income, education, and political leadership is strongly linked to this kind of behavior. Female employment and educational achievement and lower fertility rates are also linked to individualism.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>GRAMMAR&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>PASSIVE VOICE&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>A.

"reward": "<p>Project Work</p> <p><strong>Go to the forest or a garden and observe how plants, insects and animals depend on each other. Present your observations in the class.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>I saw many different types of plants like trees, flowers and bushes growing in the forest. Some insects like bees and butterflies were flying from one plant to other. I noticed that the bees were collecting nectar from the flowers. This helps the flowers to grow and produces fruits. The flowers depend on the bees for pollination.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>I also saw little bugs crawling on the leaves of plants. I think these bugs help decompose dead leaves and return nutrients to the soil. This enriches the soil and help new plants to grow.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Near a small stream, I spotted some birds catching insects. These birds get food from the insects. I also noticed insects sitting on tree branches. Some small lizards were on the branches trying to catch the insects. So there is a connection between plants, insects and small animals in the forest.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In the garden, I saw ants carrying pieces of leaves and food. Worms were found in the soil turning dead plants into manure. Butterflies were sipping nectar from different flowers. Even bigger animals like sparrows and crows were hunting for food.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>It was interesting to see how different living things in the forest and garden are interconnected and depend on each other in many ways for their survival. The plants provide food and habitat, the insects and small animals help in pollination and decay of plants. This balance in the ecosystem keeps the forest and garden healthy.</p> <p><br /></p> "

Where were Frank and Nicole employed?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Frank and Nicole were employed at&nbsp;</span>World Trade Center <span>as architects.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. How does the author describe Frank's attachment to the twin towers?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>The author describes Frank's attachment to the twin towers as a source of income and a source of fascination.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>C. How did the two families become intimate with each other?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Their children are what led two families to become intimate with each other.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. What, according to Nicole, did Frank think of the towers?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>A tower was a great human achievement, according to Nicole, and Frank was quite connected to it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. Why did Frank want to help the people in the tower after the attack?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Immediately after the attack, Frank wanted to help those in the tower because he was aware of its strength and durability and the fact that it had an emergency exit.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. Why did Frank not follow Nicole's request even after knowing that the building was on fire?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Frank didn't follow Nicole's advice even though he knew that the building was on fire. He wanted to direct the evacuees to people and help those who were in need.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. Who did Frank call from the building after the attack?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Frank called his sister Nina from the building where the attack was taking place and told her about it.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. How did Nicole feel after the collapse of the first tower?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>After the first tower collapsed, Nicole felt as though she were in the midst of a nuclear winter.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>i. Were Frank's children serious as soon as they heard the news of their missing father? Why?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>No, Frank's children did not take the news of their father's disappearance seriously because they were too busy playing games and too young.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>CRITICAL THINKING</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>a. Many innocent people lose their lives in ruthless attacks every year. What do you think the governments should do to protect their people from such attacks and make the world a safer place to live? Discuss with your friends.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Even though many citizens are murdered in brutal attacks every year, it is not desirable since the state must protect its citizens. A country's government is accountable for its citizens' safety and security. Every country's government should be concerned about global security and work together to ensure everyone's safety.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>The government must protect the country and its residents from dangers such as foreign strikes and terrorist acts. A government is in charge of defense, foreign policy, national security, the economy, and social services.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>The government should take several measures. Government should create courts and prisons, and elect or appoint people to pass and execute laws. Taxation should be utilized to support an army and police force.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Finally, the government should preserve peace and order, establish strict laws, aid its citizens, and protect the nation and its people.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Revenge and violence are integral parts of history and civilization. They can't be ignored, only managed. Do you agree or not with this statement? Present your logic.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Yes, I agree with this.&nbsp;</span>Violence and revenge have been around for a long time in human society. If nothing is done, it may cause more problems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>When people are hurt physically or emotionally, they want to get back at the person who hurt them. This makes them feel very angry and hateful. Being abused makes them feel weak, ashamed and disrespected. Hurting the other person back makes them feel better.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>After World War 1, the Treaty of Versailles was too hard on Germany. It made them pay a lot of money and feel humiliated. In 1939, Germany started World War 2 as a way to get revenge for how they were treated.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Revenge can be good or bad. Different types of violence include hurting people emotionally, physically or sexually. Many things cause violence like biology, how people grow up, what they think, and their environment. So revenge and violence have always been part of how humans and societies work.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>WRITING</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>A. Write a description of an event that you have recently witnessed.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>A few weeks back, I was walking to school at 8:00 a.m. As I walked near Bhrikuti Chowk, two young motorcycle’s crashed into a vehicle. The motorbike riders landed around four feet distant. One of the two young victims died there. The motorcyclist received a severe right-side head injury. Despite his injuries, he recovered. They were sent to hospital. This horrifying accident left me astonished and awed. That night I had nightmares. This is a past incident that still bothers me.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>B. Human life does not pass as one expects.

Write an essay on 'An Unforgettable Event in my Life' in roughly 500 words.</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span>'An Unforgettable Event in my Life'</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p>One night in 2019, I was riding my bike home after class. It was late and dark. As I rode by, I saw four drunk men bothering a girl on a scooter.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>They stopped her and were teasing her. One of the men told me to keep going and not get involved. But as I turned to leave, I saw how scared and upset the girl looked. I knew I couldn't just leave her there.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>I got off my bike and ran over to them. I punched one of the men in the stomach and threw rocks at the others. But there were four of them, so I knew I couldn't win a fight. They started beating me up - my face, stomach, back and legs all got hit.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>While they were focusing on me, I yelled at the girl to run away. She took off on her scooter. The men kept hitting me but I tried my best to defend myself. Eventually they left.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>I made it home bruised but not badly hurt. Even though it was painful, I went to sleep with a smile. Helping that girl changed me. Now when I see people needing help, I try to stick up for them. You don't have to be strong or a hero - just help when you can, because it could save a life.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Grammar</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>B.

He gets taken into museums and gets enrolled in special programs and goes to summer camp, where he takes classes. When he's bored at home, there are plenty of books to read, and his parents see it as their responsibility to keep him actively engaged in/ with the world beside/except him.

Study the event and prepare a report including the information based on the following questions. Present your report to the class.</strong></p> <p><strong>• What is the event?</strong></p> <p><strong>• When did it happen?</strong></p> <p><strong>• Why did it happen?</strong></p> <p><strong>• What were the consequences?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Event: The 1934 Nepal–Bihar earthquake</p> <p><br /></p> <p>When did it happen: On January 15, 1934</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Why did it happen: This earthquake was caused by movement along the Main Frontal Thrust fault zone located in western Nepal. Fault movements during earthquakes occur due to a build up of stresses in the earth's crust over centuries. This particular fault ruptured, releasing energy in the form of seismic waves, causing tremendous shaking and damage.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>What were the consequences: This earthquake had a magnitude of 8.0 on the Richter scale. It is considered one of the deadliest earthquakes to have hit the region. Official estimates report that over 8,500 people lost their lives due to the quake and many more were injured. Hundreds of thousands were left homeless as vast rural areas suffered massive damage with mudbrick houses collapsing. Critical infrastructure like roads, health facilities and temples were destroyed. Entire villages were wiped out by landslides and ground fractures triggered by the earthquake. Relief and rescue efforts were hampered due to the remote location and lack of resources at the time. The event caused devastating losses and long term impacts on the economy and living standards in Nepal and also neighboring regions of India.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In conclusion, the powerful 1934 Nepal-Bihar earthquake was a tragic event that led to immense loss of life and property due to the region's vulnerability to quakes combined with lack of preparedness at the time. The impact underlined the need for improved earthquake safety measures.</p> <p><br /></p> "

Write True or False after each statement. Give reason for your answer.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>a. The author says his father was an ideal person in the family. False : he was an alcoholic.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>b. The author wanted to forgive his father but he did not get an opportunity. False- because he had many stresses and pressures.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>C. It's worth forgiving a person if he/she realizes his/her mistakes. True&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>d.

How does the author remember his family environment when he was a small boy?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>The author remembers witnessing his father physically and verbally abusing his mother when he was a small boy.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Why does the author blame the system more than his father?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>The author blames more on the system than he does on his father since the system puts so much burden on his father that he is unable to free himself.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. How does the principle of forgiveness work?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>This self-sufficient idea of forgiveness does not depend on the actions of others. People don't forgive to benefit others, according to this belief. Instead, they forgive to benefit themselves.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. How does the author interpret the noises, squalls and tantrums of his children?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Parental failure, annoyance, agitation, tiredness, and so on are all metaphors used by the author to interpret his children's noises, squalls and tantrums.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e.

According to the author, is it heredity or environment that shapes a man's character? Explain.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>According to the author, a man's character is shaped by his surroundings. It's not heredity, but circumstances and settings that make people become liars, rapists, or terrorists.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. Why is forgiveness important in our life?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Forgiveness is important in our lives because it lessens stress, anxiety, melancholy, and suffering.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>CRITICAL THINKING&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>A. Desmond Tutu once said, “Forgiving is not forgetting; it's actually remembering and not using your right to hit back. It's a second chance for a new beginning.\" Does this quotation apply to this text? Analyze.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>When you give, you're not forgetting; you're remembering.\" Desmond Tutu stresses the importance of remembering. So that you can avoid making the same errors again. This quotation is appropriate given the subject matter of this essay. The author's father's marital violence carries over into the author's life.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Forgiveness means not staying angry at someone for a mistake. The dictionary says it's letting go of resentment. But true forgiveness is more than that. It doesn't make you forget what happened. It even lets the past affect your feelings.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>True forgiveness frees the victim, not the offender. It doesn't erase the wrong thing that was done. Instead of hatred, forgiveness can create understanding, caring, and feeling for the other person. It brings a calm feeling so you can get on with life. Forgetting is the opposite of remembering. Forgiveness doesn't change the past, it changes how you feel about it now.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. The author interprets 'I am sorry' as three hardest words to say. How does it apply to your life?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>It's difficult to say \"I'm sorry,\" according to the author. That is applied in my life as well.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>We may either make or ruin a relationship with a simple \"I'm sorry\". We all make errors in our everyday lives, but we only ever apologize when we are ashamed of our faults. For this reason, saying these three words is among life's biggest challenges. A sincere apology can do wonders for our reputation. Apologizing for mistakes and taking responsibility for them fosters confidence in the future that this will not happen again. The vast majority of people, on the other hand, refuse to accept it.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>WRITING&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>The author talks about the dual education system based on race in South Africa in the second half of the twentieth century. We also have private schools and public schools in Nepal. What should be done to make education equal to all citizens of Nepal? Write a couple of paragraphs expressing your views.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span>Private and Public Schools in Nepal&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Nepal's education system should strive to provide equal opportunities and quality education for all citizens, regardless of their economic or social backgrounds. Some steps that could help make education more equitable include:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Expanding access to free public schools across the country. Currently, public schools are lacking in rural areas, making education inaccessible for many poor families. The government should prioritize building more public schools even in remote villages to ensure every child can attend school nearby.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Improving the standards of public school education. Public schools need adequate funding, infrastructure, well-trained teachers and up-to-date learning materials to improve learning outcomes. A quality education in public schools can help remove the need for expensive private schools that are out of reach for most.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Providing subsidized college education. Higher education remains unaffordable for many despite scholarships. The government could directly subsidize a certain number of seats in public colleges or offer student loans at nominal interest rates to financially support meritorious students from poorer backgrounds.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Implementing targeted programs to boost enrollment of underprivileged groups. For example, girls from rural areas face socio-economic barriers that prevent their schooling. Strategies like stipends conditional to school attendance can encourage families to educate their daughters.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>An equitable and inclusive education system is crucial for Nepal to develop an informed citizenry and a just society. With sustained efforts, all Nepali children can have equal access to learning regardless of their financial circumstances.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>GRAMMAR:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>A.

When a younger man accidentally bumped into her, she dropped her bags and everything spilled on the floor. Instead of helping her pick things up, the man started yelling at her and using rude language. As a crowd began to gather, he said demeaning things about older people. That's when I stepped in - I told the man his behavior was disrespectful and discriminatory against senior citizens. I helped the woman gather her items as others also joined in. I reminded everyone of the importance of showing compassion to the vulnerable, regardless of age. While the man walked away angrily, many people thanked me for speaking up. It made me realize that small acts of discrimination in society need to be addressed, so we can build a more inclusive community for all.</p> <p><br /></p> "

Why did the author and his classmates decide to visit Bandipur?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>They had had enough of the busy life in Kathmandu, so they traveled to Bandipur with a group of their friends.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. What is special about Bandipur?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Bandipur is a unique area since it is a Newar town where ancient Nepal is still alive and well.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. How has the business changéd in Bandipur today?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Bandipur's original industry has evolved into a tourism-related business today.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Why do the local people who have migrated to Kathmandu visit Bandipur time and again?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Locals who have migrated to Kathmandu return to Bandipur to relieve the city's hustle and bustle.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. How do the local people learn to speak English in Bandipur?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Locals in Bandipur learn English from schoolchildren to communicate with visitors and for family business.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. What does the author mean when he says that ‘time stops in the town of Bandipur’?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>By saying \"time stops in Bandipur\", the author is conveying how the town has a laidback, leisurely tempo of living where people are not governed or hurried by time constraints. Life moves at a relaxed and comfortable pace.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>CRITICAL THINKING</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>a. The writer seems to believe that rural life is better than urban life. Do you agree with him?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>I wholeheartedly agree with what the writer has believed. He appears to believe in the benefits of rural living since he is fed up with the frantic lifestyle in Kathmandu and wants to see the actual beauty of Bandipur, a place where ancient Nepal lives. Because of this, he and his friends go there to get some peace of mind.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>According to the author, food is less expensive in rural locations than it is in cities, making it possible for a person to feed his or her family properly. Rural locations also have lower crime and traffic rates.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Rural residents run their own businesses, depend on local food and services, and enjoy beautiful landscapes. We can live there with all the open space and pure air.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Is the writer's way of looking at Bandipur just the gaze of an urban tourist? Why? Why not?</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>No, the writer's view of Bandipur is not that of an urban tourist. In fact, he is fascinated by the indigenous customs, mannerisms, and cuisine. He and his friends take a moment to look at the beautiful things in the area as if they were in a place called paradise.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Bandipur is a place where people go to relax and unwind from their busy lives. It is a city that is pollution-free, traditional, and has a lot of different cultures. One can see old palaces and temples, go on safaris, ride elephants, and more. People not only go there to have fun, but also to get some peace too.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>WRITING</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Write a letter to a business organization overseas describing the prospects of the tourism industry in your local place.

I told you that Nepal's tourist industry had a lot of opportunities for improvement. Nepal is also a diverse country in terms of its people, cultures, and religions. In my own locale, there are many opportunities for expansion in the tourist industry.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Baglung is the name of the city where I reside. It is located in the Western Development Region of Nepal. Beautiful lakes, breathtaking mountains, and friendly people from across the planet are just some of the reasons why this place is so amazing. Baglung, a city with a rich religious and historical past, has been the major destination of all kinds of tourists ranging from religious to nature loving tourists.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Baglung's most recognizable spot is the Temple of Goddess Bhagwati, located in the city's heart. The country's tallest and longest bridge connects Baglung and Parbat. Photographing the gorgeous surroundings is an extra way to enjoy the journey.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Recently, a number of new children's amusement parks have opened, including BP Smriti Park and others. Children and teens' definitions of enjoyment are being widened in a variety of ways. Minibusses, vans, and battery rickshaws are among the means of transportation that may be used to come to Baglung. There is also a semi-opened airport here. Visitors may enjoy fine dining and a comfortable bed at a few 3-star hotels here. An enormous number of tourists come here each year.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>I'd appreciate it if you could help me spread the word about the booming tourism business in my hometown.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>I look forward to hearing from you</span></p> <p><span>Yours faithfully.</span></p> <p><span>SR Sharma</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>GRAMMAR:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>A.

Describe the physical appearance of the young lady.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>The young woman looked beautiful in her gray and simple dress along with &nbsp;her rolled hairstyle. She looked soft and shy, with dreamy bright eyes, real peachblow cheeks, and a happy mood that was tinged with memories.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. What changes did Pitcher notice in the young lady?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>Pitcher noticed a few changes in the young girl. She stayed in the outer office rather than going immediately to her desk in the next room, and she walked close enough to Maxwell's desk for him to see her.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. What was Pitcher's reply to the young lady concerning a new stenographer ?</strong></p> <p><span>Pitcher’s reply to the young lady concerning a new stenographer was that Maxwell had advised him to hire another stenographer and he had notified the agency the previous afternoon to provide samples that day but no one had shown up.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e.

What message does the writer want to give by presenting Maxwell as an extremely absent-minded person?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>In the story \"The Romance of a Busy Broker,\" the author portrays Maxwell as a person who is very forgetful. He is a busy broker who always checks and works on telegrams, mail, telephones and business. He is so busy that he doesn't have time to pay attention to anyone, even his recently married wife.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Author is trying to teach men who haven't taken care of their parents, siblings, or relatives that this isn't acceptable behavior.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>As they work on their task, they become so busy that they become addicted to their daily chores. He also forgets his wife and marriage because he has a lot to do. In this way, the writer tells people that being a good family member is more important than working hard or taking care of other things.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b.

Write how you were troubled emotionally when your own husband came to you and made a marriage proposal.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>I am Miss Leslie, the wife of Maxwell. He chose to propose to me and asked me to marry him after being fascinated by the scent of me. As I was already married to him, I was astonished at first, then I burst into tears, and ultimately I smiled and placed my arms around his neck and informed him that we had married the night before.

Why did Iqbal want to sleep in the afternoon?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>Iqbal wanted to sleep in the afternoon because he had spent the night sitting on his bedroll in a packed third-class cabin of a train.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. How did people react with each other on the train?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>People were fighting and arguing over each other since the train was full.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. Why did the book Iqbal was reading bring commotion in the compartment?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>The book Iqbal was reading brought commotion in the train because he was reading it in English and the compartment felt it was intelligent. They praised and thought it was prestigious because they did not know English.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Why did Iqbal have to give clarification with his personal details?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>Iqbal had to give clarification with his personal details about his background due to his reputation as an intelligent and smart traveler and since he was the only one with decent understanding of English language.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. Who was Meet Sing and what did he report to Iqbal?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>Meet Singh was the priest of Gurudwara and he reported to Iqbal about the murder of a fellow villager perhaps committed by Jugga.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. How, according to Meet Singh, was Jugga Sing different from his forefathers?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>According to Meet Singh, Jugga singh stole and murdered members of his own village in order to keep the locals safe from other dacoits, unlike his forefathers who, like him, were dacoits, but who never plundered or killed their own village people.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. How does the author Show contradictions in Meet Singh's character?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>The author uses two approaches to show Meet Singh's personality contradictions. He showed his positive attitude by saying he was more concerned about a villager's death than Jugga's. On the opposite hand, He planned to swear on the holy granth that Jugga was praying at the Gurudwara at the time of his murder to establish his innocence.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. Who was Hukum Chand and how did he succeed in his career?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>Deputy Sahib Hukum Chand, better known as Nar adami, was Hukum Chand. As a result of his passion for pleasing his Sahibs, who promoted him on a regular basis, he was able to achieve professional success.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>CRITICAL THINKING&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>a. Iqbalis addressed as Babu Sahib by general folk simply because he knew English. Are Nepali people who can speak English taken with respect? Discuss the importance of learning English in the Nepali context.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>In the essay \"Train to Pakistan\", the author presents Iqbal as a prestigious person as he knows English well. Furthermore, he is addressed as Babu Sahib by general folk simply because he knew English. In Nepalese context, people give respect to people who can speak English, too. English plays quite a multi dimensional role in day to day life in present Nepalese context.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Speaking English and having wide knowledge of it is widely respected in the Nepalese society. The influence of English is high in the education system of Nepal as well. English is taken as a compulsory subject in schools and colleges and universities. It is used as a medium of communication in banks, railway stations, bus stations, airways, educational sector, medical, private sector, etc. English is a link language and is used in trade and business both at national and international level.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Do you agree with Iqbal's comments on crime and punishment? In your view, what should the state, society and individuals do for peace and order in social lives?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Yes, I support the way Iqbal comments on crime and punishment in the essay \"Train to Pakistan.\"&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Everyone has a role in the world. People should be kind to each other and mediate fairly if any conflict arises in the place. Peacebuilding strategies, conflict management, conflict resolution, and nonviolence should be followed by everybody.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>The role of society is to help people be included in order to improve social cohesion and build on human relations in society, which leads to peace and growth. It helps communities build the skills they need to protect themselves, which helps build peace.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>The role of the State is to protect and improve the economic and political interests of the people who run the country.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>WRITING&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>A. Meet Singh says Jugga is a badmash. There can be such people in your locality, too. Write a paragraph describing him/her.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>There used to be a \"badmash\" named Harke in our area too. He was the most unpopular thug and robber of our village. He has robbed other communities nearby. He had killed hundreds of people. He was idolized by his fellow local gangs. He used to constantly carry a gun. He looked dirty, cynical and cruel with a large beard and big eyes. At the age of 46, Police arrested him and condemned him to life in jail; he died there.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>B. You may have traveled by bus or train. During your travels, you might have had different experiences. Write a letter to your friend describing your unforgettable journey.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>22nd January, 2022</span></p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>Chitwan, Nepal</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Dear friend,</p> <p><br /></p> <p>I hope this letter finds you well. I'm writing to share with you about an unforgettable journey I recently took by bus.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The trip was meant to be a simple two-hour ride to visit my grandparents in the next town. However, things did not exactly go according to plan! Shortly after departing, the bus started having some mechanical issues. It began jerking and losing speed on the hilly road. The driver tried working on it for over an hour but had no luck getting it started again.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>By this time, it had started raining heavily and all the passengers were soaked and frustrated by the long delay. Some even started arguing loudly with the driver. It seemed we would be stranded on the lonely mountain road overnight!</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Thankfully, just when we had lost all hope, another bus happened to pass by. The driver saw our broken-down bus and decided to help. He squeezed all 40 of us into his already full bus and delivered us safely to the next town.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>I was exhausted but also felt a sense of relief and gratitude. The unexpected difficulties of the journey made arriving at my destination all the more sweet. I hope my letter finds you well. Please write back and share any interesting travel stories of your own.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Talk to you soon,</p> <p><span>Your friend,</span></p> <p><span>Rajan</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>B. Here is an extract from a newspaper article about a missing boy&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>(Ronish) and his father (Naresh). Decide why different forms of past tenses were used.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>The given extract uses different forms of past tenses because&nbsp;</strong><span>the sentences are written in the form of a report or a story. So, the Past simple passive tense is used.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>We use the past simple when we want to talk about things that have happened in the past. So, the past perfect tense is used in the extract to show that something happened in the past.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>C. Fill in the gaps with the suitable form of the verb in the brackets. Use past simple/past continuous<em>/</em>past perfect tenses. You may need to use negative too.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>It was Sunday afternoon.

The dediasporization process for migrants who have not given up &nbsp;their native citizenship -Vi. requires them only to return to their homeland.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>e.

The role of a state in diasporization -ii, reveals its cientity&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>B. Answer the following questions.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>a. According to the author, what are the three aspects of migration?</strong></p> <p><span>Forward movement, migrants themselves, and backward movement are the three aspects of migration, according to the author.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Which aspect of migration is neglected by the researchers?</strong></p> <p><span>Researchers tend to neglect the multifaceted nature of the dediasporization process.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. What is 'dediasporization'?</strong></p> <p>Diaspora generally refers to the dispersion of a population from its original homeland. Dediasporization would involve efforts to repatriate or reconnect a dispersed population group back to its ancestral lands or culture. It can involve things like encouraging immigration back to the homeland, cultural/nationalist movements, or policies aimed at strengthening ties between the diaspora and its place of origin. So it's the opposite process of diasporization/dispersion.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Why is the role of the state important in dediasporization?</strong></p> <p><span>When someone leaves their home country, the state has a big influence on the process because it makes sure that the person is eligible to become a citizen again, with all of the rights and responsibilities that come with it. The state also has set rules for how it makes decisions in each case.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. How is the Chinese diaspora in the Caribbean different from others?</strong></p> <p><span>The Caribbean Chinese diaspora is different from others because the locals still see them as outsiders, despite the fact that they have been there for over a century.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. Why is it difficult to regain citizenship after returning to the homeland?</strong></p> <p><span>Regaining citizenship after returning to one's native country is difficult because it depends on the state's decision to provide legal validity to citizens. Some nations allow individuals to relinquish their citizenship, but the process of reclaiming it might be very difficult.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. What do the Germans feel towards the returnees from Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan?</strong></p> <p><span>Returnees from Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan are treated differently by Germans than German citizens and other members of society.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. How are the returnees' activities in Israel different from that of other countries?</strong></p> <p><span>The actions of returning citizens in Israel are different from those in other nations. They mention full citizenship from their political parties and push for the rights of other Israeli citizens.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>i. What is the role of the individual in dediasporization?</strong></p> <p><span>Dediasporization relies on the individual to integrate with the local population, maintain their nationality, and participate in the process of nation-building.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>CRITICAL THINKING&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>a. Many Nepali people are living in foreign countries now and they are known as Non Residential Nepalis (NRNS). The NRNs are asking for dual citizenship rights. Do you think the Government of Nepal should address their demands?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Non-Residential Nepalis, as the name implies, are individuals who have left Nepal and are now residing in other countries (NRNS). In Nepal, this is a growing trend. Some of them have dual citizenship with the nations in which they now live in the U.S. and another country.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>People in Nepal cannot be citizens of two countries at the same time, according to the law. They have to leave one nation and give up their citizenship in order to get citizenship in another. As a result, many individuals are forced to relinquish their nationality.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Non-Resident Nepalis' desires should not be addressed by the government in the sense that one should not be able to have dual citizenship in two countries at the same time. Non-Resident Nepalis, despite their love, passion, and loyalty to the nation, are not allowed to legally have dual citizenship.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Non-Resident Nepalis should not be granted citizenship as a long-term solution, but rather should be given the opportunity to work inside the country for the well-being and happiness of its population as a whole.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. The NRNs celebrate festivals like Teej, Dashain, Lhosar, Id and Holi in foreign countries. What do these celebrations signify?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Non-Residential Nepalis are Nepalis who reside outside of Nepal (NRNs). Festivals like Lhosar, Id.

Nepali student migration&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>A bar graph shows how many Nepalese students departed between 2009 and 2010. It was in 2009-2010.

That is, a different sort of familial purpose is least to blame for the flood of people entering the country. The second most popular motivation for migration is a better lifestyle.

Can you tell me your name and a little about your background?</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Interviewee: My name is Sagar Shrestha. I lived and worked in the United States for 10 years after completing my Master's degree there. I worked as a software engineer for a large tech company.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Me: What made you decide to return to Nepal permanently after living abroad for so long?</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Interviewee: There were a few key factors. I really missed my family and culture being so far away. After my parents got older, I wanted to be closer to help care for them. I also felt a strong pull to contribute to Nepal's development in a meaningful way. While I had a good career in the US, I felt unfulfilled and wanted my work to directly impact people here.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Me: That's very inspiring. What specific plans do you have now for how you'll contribute in Nepal?</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Interviewee: I'm in the process of launching a social enterprise focused on improving rural education. I want to develop interactive digital learning tools and content tailored for Nepali village schools. My background in ed-tech from Silicon Valley will hopefully help address the shortage of quality educational resources outside cities. In 5 years I hope to reach 500 schools across multiple districts. I'm also teaching part-time at a local university to share my global experience with students here.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Me: Those sound like amazing initiatives that can really make a difference.

Why does Audre Lorde think that Mary got a sort of victory in the University of Boston?</strong></p> <p><span>At the University of Boston, Audre Lorde believed that Mary had won since she discovered many women there who were speaking up and empowering each other.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>b. Why is Lorde thankful to Mary?</strong></p> <p><span>Lorde is thankful to Mary for presenting her with Gyn/Ecology, a book that is full of value, useful, generative, stimulating, and strengthening.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>c. What impression has the writer had about the way white women looked upon black women?</strong></p> <p><span>The writer had a bad impression when white women couldn't hear what the black ladies were saying, and they couldn't keep up with the black women like the author's lengthy and frustrating conversation.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>d. Why did Mary not cast black women as goddesses in her book according to Lorde?</strong></p> <p><span>As said by Lorde. Due to her deliberate choice to focus on Western European women solely, Mary did not portray black women as goddesses in her novel.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>e. Why did Lorde think that she misused her words?</strong></p> <p><span>Her use of Lorde's statements was seen by Lorde as an attempt to discredit Lorde as a woman of color.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>f. For Lorde, how were women, especially from the black community, undervalued?</strong></p> <p><span>According to Lorde, women of color, in particular those of the black ethnicity, were underestimated because of the patriarchal values of white women in western Europe.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>g. How does Mary take white women as? Does Lorde agree with Mary's view?</strong></p> <p><span>It is Mary's belief that white women are the real source of power and background for all females, whereas non-white women's history are only notable as instances of female oppression. Lorde disagrees with Mary's point of view because she believes that Mary has shown the superiority of white feminism over black feminism by treating black people as if they were ornaments and neglecting their suffering and oppression. Lorde believes that Mary's position is inherently racist.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>h. What is Afrekete? How does it connect to this lesson?</strong></p> <p><span>Afrekete is the voice of black lesbian literary tradition. This lesson \"An Open Letter to Mary Daly\" is linked to this one in the sense that the author wishes to unite all the black women in the arena of black literature by using this method of communication.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>CRITICAL THINKING&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>a. \"The oppression of women knows no ethnic or racial boundaries.\" Do you agree or not? Justify with your reasons.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>The mistreatment of women exists across all ethnicities and races. However, the type and level of mistreatment may differ based on other factors like a woman's background.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>All women deal with some common problems. But a Black woman's experience will not always be exactly the same as an Asian or White woman's. Things like a person's job, income level, sexual orientation, and race can also impact how they are treated.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>During the coronavirus pandemic in America, this has been especially clear. Many important frontline jobs, like working in grocery stores or delivering food, are done by women of color. They have faced greater risks because of their gender and ethnicity.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>While all women worldwide deal with issues related to their gender, each individual woman's situation is unique. A woman's race, economic status, and other parts of who she is affect the specific challenges she faces. So although mistreatment crosses ethnic boundaries, the nature and degree of it varies considerably depending on a woman's full identity and circumstances.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>Writing&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>A. Have you ever faced or witnessed cases of racial or sexual discrimination? Write a short account.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>When I was in university, I witnessed an act of racial discrimination towards one of my classmates. Jane was a talented student from an ethnic minority background. During a group project presentation, one of the other students constantly interrupted and undermined Jane's comments, dismissing her ideas without good reason. It seemed clear the intent was to sabotage Jane's contributions just because of her race.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As Jane's friend, it upset me to see her treated that way for no reason other than the color of her skin. She worked very hard and deserved to be judged based on her abilities, not attributes beyond her control. Events like that taught me discrimination remains a problem, and showed how much harm it can cause both emotionally and in terms of opportunities for those targeted. It's important that as a society we continue efforts to promote inclusion and fairness for all.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>B. Write an article for a national daily on \"The Status of Women in Nepali Society.\"&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span>The Status of Women in Nepali Society&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></p> <p>Kathmandu, 13th August , 2023</p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Women's status varies according to geography, caste, economy, religion, and social structure. Nepal's standing as a country for women cannot be praised highly enough. More than 60% of women are uneducated.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>In principle, they are equal under the constitution, but in practice, they are not. They cannot participate in public affairs because of the dominant cultural mindset. They have remained hidden because of the caste system, traditional eating customs, and the focus on virginity.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Among their chores include cooking, laundry, and kid care. Family breadwinners are males, whereas women are only considered as domestic and maternity carers. Women must work at home. Hindu women are meant to be financially dependent on males from birth to death. Household duties include gathering wood and fuel for fireplaces, transporting water, gardening, and assisting males and other family members.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>Nepalese women are also pushed into prostitution and sold as commercial sexworkers due to harsh legislation. They work 16 hours a day in agriculture, carpet manufacturing, and wage labor.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><span>In a nutshell, Mahatma Gandhi said that man and woman are the two wheels of a cart that must operate together. Mothers in particular guide the rest of the family. As a consequence, without adequate education and economic rights for women, the family cannot flourish.</span></p> <p><br /></p>  <p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.
